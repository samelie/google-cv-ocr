Gentlemen:-
I am enclosing you herewith a copy of a letter which Mr.
E. W. Carroll has just sent me.
Mr. Carroll so clearly explains some things that I feel it will
not be asking too much of you to consider his letter.
The wild rumors which were on the streets at that time, are all
understood now in Athens, and he is right in saying that the majority
the people in Athens and in this county are entirely changed in their
views, and feel after knowing the truth about the case, that Dr.
Summerlin should be pardoned.
Thanking you for your patience and kind consideration in this
matter, I am

Dear Sirs:-
In Re: Application M.T.Summerlin.
This crime was committed in the home county of the
Presiding Judge, at the time , Judge Andrew J. Cobb, and I would
be glad to have the Commission ask Judge Cobb, for his views
in this matter, especially since there is another of the defend-
ants to be tried in this case. Any favorable action in this
application would of course result in acquitab of the other joint
defendant. I will concur in what Judge Cobb says. I am writing
to the associate counsel in the case.
Yours very truly,

To His Excellency, the Governor:
Sir: The Prison Commission have had under consideration an application for executive
clemency in behalf of M. I. Summerlin
who, at the... April... term, 19 19. of the Superior
Court of Clarke County..., was convicted of. Manslaughter
and sentenced to...3. years....
...., a statement of the facts of said
application being hereto attached, and beg leave to report that they
Recommend Pardon
for the following reasons:
Executive clemency is recommended by a very large
number of citizens of Athens and other sections of the State
-where..he..is known...Dr.Summerlin .shown .be...a mano
highest personal character and we feel that taking this into
"Consideration and owing to the character of the evidence, the
dissenting opinion of Judge Luke of the Court of Appeals, and
the state ments of Dr. Waters since the trial, that there is such
a doubt as to the guilt of the applicant, that he should be
pardoned at the expiresnestfully submittedar's service, which is the
minimum sentence for the crime of
involuntary manslaughter.

STATEMENT OF FACTS:
M. T. Summerling was convicted of involuntary manslaughter
in the commission of an unlawful act. The person killed was
Viola Parr. Her death was caused by an abortion. She had been
employed in the office of the applicant, who was a dentist, and
in....dying declaration she said that Dr. Summerlin was..the father
of the child and that Dr. Watersproduced the abortion in Dr.
Summerlin's office. There is a dispute as to whether Dr. Summerlin


was connected with the crime. The case was affirmed on an appeal
to the Court of Appeals by two Judges, Bloodworth and Broyles,dJ.
Judge Luke in a vigorous dissent holds that the evidence is not
sufficient to convict. 25 Appeals 568. Dr. Waters was given a
new trial by the Court of Appeals upon the ground that the Jury
had out with them the verdict in Summerlin case - 25 Appeals 577.
Dr. Waters has not again been put on trial. It is testified
to by affidavit of John E. Talmadge, Jr., A. Rhodes and F.J.Bell
that since the trial they have talked to Dr. Waters several times
and that he has stated to them that Dr. Summerlin had no connec-
tion whatever with the dilation performed upon Miss Parr, that he
did not procure it, was not present, and so far as he knew had
no interest in it.
Executive clemency is recommended by a very large number
of citizens of Athens and other sections of the State where he
is known. Dr. Summerlin is shown to be a man of highest personal
character and we feel that taking this into consideration and
owing to the character of the evidence, the dissenting opinion
of Judge Luke of the Court of Appeals, and the statements of
Dr. Waters since the trial, that there is such a doubt as to
the guilt of the applicant, that he should be pardoned at the
expiration of one year's service, which is the minimum sentence
for the crime of involuntary manslaughter.

Dear Sir s:
Dur ing the last six months I have been medical adviser
to Mr S.M.T. Summer lin and her child, and I have ob er ved a
very grave change in her , mentally and physically, in this time.
Mrs. Summerlin is a very sensitive ,refined woman, rather shy and
reserved, and of late she has shown mental changes, due largely to
worry and brooding, which I fear will eventually cau se a permanent
mental trouble.Her health has not been good- & severe attack of
scarlet fever last November was followed by an increase of an old
female trouble, and for several months I have been in constant
attendance on her.
Mr s. Summer lin has had everything done that could be done for
her ,phy sically; and I am convinced that the only hope for her is
in a change of mental status-a relief from worry and care and
if this relief is not obtained, I am afraid of a complete,
permanent mental break-down.
Sincerely,

tasks of life and restore, if possible, his wife's mind, as he
and his family have already endured most horrible punishment
for a crime of which he is innocent.
The required affidavits accompany this petition, including
the certificate of the Ordinary as to the posting of the usual
notice, and in addition thereto numerous letters, many of which have
come unsolicited and in addition thereto a special affidavit from
the Grand Jury which presented him, to which special attention is
called.
Wherefore, applicant prays that a full pardon may now
be granted unto him for the following reasons :
First: Because he is innocent of the crime of which
he was convicted and the reading of the record in this case and
the opinion of Mr. Justice Luke will sustain the statement that
his guilt has not been proven.
Second: Because other evidence is now presented than
the evidence which was presented before the Jury which con-
victed him, and if it had been possible to have gotten this
evidence submitted in proper form before the trial Jury, his
acquittal would doubtless have resulted.
Third: Because in the light of applicant's former
life and character, as evidenced by many affidavits and letters,
and because of his present conduct since serving his sentence,
it should be manifest that he has suffered much and been punished
sufficiently, even if he had originally been guilty, which is
denied.
Fourth: Because it is very probable that his wife will
entirely lose her mind and her mental condition soon be beyond
recall, unless he be permitted to return to his home and give her
the care and attention which he alone can afford.
All of which is most respectfully submitted.

if it could have been produced before the Jury trying him, would
have acquitted him, in that Dr. Waters would have testified positive-
ly that your applicant had no connection whatsoever with the
alleged operation which was the basis of the present ment found
against him. However, since the said W. G. Waters was also on
trial, his attorneys positively declined to consent for him to
become a witness in your applicant's behalf. The said waters and
his counsel were earnestly importuned, that your applicant might
have the benefit of this testimony, but they positively declined
this request and applicant's lawyers did not think it was good policy,
under these circumstances, to force the said waters upon the stand.
Your applicant herewith submits an affidavit from three
well known and reput able citizens of Athens, in which it is sworn
that the said Dr. W. G. Waters had informed the affiants that your
applicant had no connection whatsoever with the transaction
which is the basis of this prosecution.
This evidence was not submitted to the trial Jury because
under the technical rules of law it was inadmissable, but
applicant urges that you give it full consideration; for, regardless
of the technical rules of evidence, it is the positive state-
ment of the one man who knows the truth about this transaction and
that statement is that your applicant had no connection with it.
Your applicant further shows that he has suffered great-
ly and that if he were guilty, which he denies, he has already
been confined for more than a year, including the time he was
incarcerated in jail, and has already suffered extreme punishment.
Your applicant further shows that his presence at home
is most urgently needed; his wife and child have suffered much
due to his absence, and that at present his wife's mind is
hanging in the balance and that any day her mental condition
may give way and she may become a hopelessly mental wreck.
In this
connection special attention is called to the affidavit of Dr.
A. B. Patton, his wife's attending physician. Applicant urges
upon you that he be permitted to return home and take up the


declaration, did not say that Dr. Summerlin, this defendant,
advised the abortion, or aided in it, or had anything to do with
it. There was no other evidence which connected this defendant
with the crime charged. This court said, in Butler v.. State, il
Ga. App. 815, 76 S. E. 368:
"Mere proof of presence by the accused, when the criminal
act was committed by another, and of subsequent flight, does not
in the absence of evidence showing that the accused advised or
abetted the commission of the crime, authorize his conviction."
The Supreme Court said in Futch v. State, 137 Ga. 76,
72 S. E. 911 (3-a):
"Mere presence and participation in the general trans-
action in which a homicide is committed is not conslusive evi-
dence of consent and concurrence in the perpetration of a crime by
a defendant, sought to be held responsible for the homicide as
aiding and abetting the actual perpetrator, unless such defendant
participated in the felonious design of the person killing."
In the case which we have here for review there is not
one word of evidence which connects this defendant with the killing
of the deceased. The nearest approach we have to it is that
another person in the office of this defendant committed the
crime, with not one word of evidence that the defend ant knew
that the crime was being committed, or counseled it or advised
it. For this reason, I do not think the verdict was authorized
by the evidence."
Applicant now submits that his application for a pardon
does not come before you as the usual case in which the judg-
ment has been confirmed, but presents to you a situation where
a strong dissenting opinion is filed and where one of three
learned justices closes his dissenting opinion with this language,
"For this reason, I do not think the verdict was authorized by the
evidence."
Your applicant further shows that he was jointly indict-
ed with one Dr. W. G. Waters and that the testimony of Dr. Waters,

GEORGIA, O TO THE HON. HUGH M. DORSEY, GOVERNOR AND
CLARKE COUNTY. | THE HON. PRISON COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA
M. T. Summerlin, applicant, respectfully shows as follows:
That at the April Term, 1919 of Clarke Superior Court
he was presented by the Grand Jury of said County, on which
presentment he was placed on trial in the Superior Court of
Clarke County in the following May and convicted by the Jury
in said Court of involuntary manslaughter, in the commission
of an unlawful act.
Your applicant shows that in October, 1920 he entered
upon his term of service and that he is now confined in the Confed-
erate soldiers' Home in Atlanta under order of the Prison Commission
of this State.
Although applicant has been convicted and sentenced under
the law of the state, he still denies his guilt and here and now
reiterates that he was not and is not guilty of the crime of which
he was convicted.
Whereas it is true that the Court of Appeals of said State
upheld the verdict of guilt, it was by a divided court and Judge
Luke, one of the presiding justices in said case, dissented from the
judgment of the court in the following strong language:
"In addition to what I have said I do not think that
the evidence in this case supported the verdict. The defendant
was convicted of the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the
commission of an unlawful act. The very best evidence and the only
evidence, which connected the defendant with the commission
of the crime was the dying declarations of the deceased, which
were testified to by one of the doctors who was with her shortly
before her death. Her death was occasioned by an abortion. Her
dying declaration was that Dr. Summerlin, the defendant in this
case, was the father of the child, and that Dr. Waters produced
the abortion in Dr. Summerlin's office. The deceased, in her dying
