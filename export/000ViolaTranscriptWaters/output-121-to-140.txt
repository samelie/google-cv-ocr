this action, for me not to leave town. I didn't see them,- don't
remember seeing Charley at all. I remember seeing Nr. Frank Parr
on the street one time. I went all about attending to my own
affairs and was up town every day.
I was doing my practice going
right on. That brings us down to Saturday. When they came to my
office was on the 3rd day of March. On March 15th, which was on
Saturday, about seven o'clock or seven-thirty in the afternoon,
my telephone rang at home. I was at home at that time which was
about supper,. I have my supper about seven or seven-thirty. My
telephone rang and I think my wife answered it; she said "some one
wants to speak to you"; I went to the phone and he said "this is
Charley Parr talking": I said "all right, Charley, what is it"; he
I did you get the message Ident you today'grand
said I have not, no man has delivered me a message from you today
at all." He says " I will deliver it to you"; I said "all right,
what is it", - perfectly surprised that he should be phoning me about
anything. He says "this is your last day in Athens"; I said "why,
Charley, what is the matter." He says "don't make any difference,
this is your last day in Athens and I am going to be looking for
you Sunday morning and I am going to kill you if I see you on the
street." That was Saturday, March 15th. Well, it was a great
surprise to me,- after they had rescinded their action I dismissed
the matter and was going on attending to my affairs. I went out
there on a call. While I was at Mr. Sam Woods, who lives on Nanta-
hala Avenue, - his sister was in a very serious condition,- I went
out and while I was there the telephone rang and Sam's wife said I
was wanted at the phone. All rifht I went. Chief Buesee said
Dr. Waters"; I said "yes, this is her; he said " I have a message
that was delievered to me from the Parr boys"; I said "all right,
Chief, what is it"; he siad " you are to get out of town and not be
seen here in the morning." That was on Sunday next. I was very
much disturbed. I didn't know what to do. I talked to my wife a
little before I went on the call. I knew the woman was suffering
intensely. I only talked a few minutes to her before I made this
109


-50
call. While I was there this phone message from Chief Beussee
came to me. Mr. Ben Woods came in about that time and I told
him of this last action of that day and I said "Mr. Woods, I don't
know what to do, - I don't want to have any trouble,- I don't
want to have any collision, - I don't want to have any tragedy." He
says " I don't know what to dok; he said "as far as I knew about this
matter it had quieted down" and I said "well, Mr. Woods, I don't
know." I says " come get in my car and go back home with me and I
want to call in a friend or two then and advise me the best method
of aboiding any trouble with anybody. I did and we went back home.
When I got back home, I went in the room, and my wife had my grip
packed. She said "daddy, I can't stand for you to stay here, -
every minute you would be out of my sight I would be afraid and
fearful after this message that has come to you that you would be
shot,- pow, you go on away for a few days and lets see what the
termination of this matter will be." I said " I don't want to go,-
I have done nothing to go for,- I have done nothing to run from and
I don't want to go." She said " I know," she had already had my
grip packed, - # but I don't want any trouble, - all of you have been
peaceable and lav-abiding citizens." I called in a friend or two
some advised me to stay and others not. I didn't know what to do.
Finally we decided, - my wife persisted that she would be perfectly
miserable every minute I was away from home. I finally decided
that, we did with those friends there, to leave Athens Sunday morning,
which was the 16th of March,. Now, to avoid any. collision or fo try
to avoid any collision at home, these friends and my wife and my
opinion was to leave home Saturday night as that was the last night
I had and spend the night away from homer, afraid there might be a
collision if I should start to leave Athens Sunday morning; I had no
way to get out of Athens on a train at that time of noght Saturday
night except this twelve o'clock train going that way, and if I had to


-51.-
1.eave home I would go to my home in Tennessee. I went to Mr. Sa m
Woods. Mr. Ben Voods was still at my house and I said "Mr. Woods,
I don't know but lets leave my house"; it was then quite up in the
night some; we went out the back way; I live on Harris street and
we went through my back yard and garden and got over the fence and
went down Milledge Avenue and struck Prince and went down I believe
Lyndon Avenue to Mr. Sam Woods ' house. I had my grip expecting
to catch the seven o'clock train Sunday morning. It was raining
very hard then and it had rained quite a good deal that afternoon
and I said "Mr. Woods, I want to get in an automobile and catch the
train in Winder in the morning, - I want to catch the vestibule, if
I can catch the vestibule train in the morning I can get home, which
is at Lebanon, Tennessee, thirty miles east of Nashville, - I can get
home by tomorro night, if I can catch this early morning vestibule."
He said "stay over here, - you will be closer to the depot; if you
do, you won't be leaving home and you can go right down the rail-
road track and catch the train here." It was raining; he said
"you couldn't hardly go in an automobile". It was bad. We decided
that before I left home that was what we would do. I went over and
we reached Sam Woods' house about ten or eleven o'clock,- some where
along there Saturday night, - still raining. We talked the matter over
and I decided I would stay there in the house, not get out on the
street until Monday morning, - give the road Sunday to dry up. I did.
I spent the day,- spent Saturday night, all day Sunday and Sunday
night at Mr. Sam Woods! on Nantahala Avenue. I got a friend and
asked him, sent word for him to come to see me Sunday; he came and I
told him of this condition. I said "I want to get out of town without
any collision, - I don't want to come incontact with Mr. Frank and
Mr. Charley Parr, - I don't want any trouble, avoiding trouble." I
said " will you carry me to Winder Monday mmorning to catch the
vestibule- he said "yes, sir". About four o'clock we left Sam
Woods residence,- had tthis gentlemen with me and Mr. Sam Woods, he
111


-52-
and I started about, eeft his house about four o'clock in the
morning and went to winder. I got to Winder and I found the
vestibule train was late; I have to catch this train in order to
make connection with the Dixie Flyer out of Atlanta. It was an
hour and a half or two hours late. I stayed in "inder until the ac-
comodation, the accomodation which comes along there I suppose about
eight o'clock. I got on that train. I bought a ticket in Winder to
Nashville, Tennessee. I got on that train and went on and I asked
the conductor,- I said "Captain, is there any chance for me to catch
the Dixie Flyer" and he said "no, I am afraid not, it will be too
late. He let me off at Howell Junction, a little station a mile or
two out of Atlanta, he said " you get off here and flag them and
probably you can get it." I did so and caught the Dixie Flyer.
That was on Monday morning, March 17th, and I arrived at Nashville
about six-thirty and went out to my home town about seven o'clock that
night. I stayed there and wrote to my wife daily and she wrote to me
and I wrote to several friends here, number of people I wrote to. I
wasn't concealing where I was. I was there and I wrote to them, put
my return on my envelope that I would write her. I stayed there from
the 17th, arrived there, I believe, the 17th of March, I arrived at
home, - I heard from my wife daily and I wrote to her most every day,
I think I did every day, and on the 28th day of March my wife phoned
me, she had written me that there was a considerable stir here and
there was a talk of some action by the courts. I says " I am not
afraid of any courts, - they can know where I am if they want to know,-
I am not concealing my absence at all"; she wrote me ma phoned me the
28th day of March to meet Colonel Shackelford and Judge West at the
Patten Hotel in Chattanooga. I left Lebanon, Tennessee, on the morning
of the 29th and I arrived in Chattanooga sbout two-thirty or three ,
o'clock on the same day.
I went to the Patten Hotel and registered for
mysell, Col. Frank Shackelford and Judge West. They came in about
eleven or twelve o'clock that night, I think, on the Southern road.
112


-53-
They came in and says "Doc, we are here representing you,- we want
you to tell us the whole truth about this matter so we will know
if there is any action, or we want to know the whole truth about
it." I says "very well , gentlemen." We went to our room,- it was
quite late then,- it was eleven or twelve o'clock when they came to
my room; they said " we will run over this thing briefly tonight
and we will finish it in the morning. I did, - went over it briefly.
I told them as n ear as I can remember word for word just what I
have you. I had a consultation with them that night and the next
day. I left home and I came with my grip packed, with my belongings,
expecting to return with them on that day, or when they came back.
I had heard of these things and I says I don't know. In the mean
time I had written a friend of mine here. He advised me that he went
to see Mr. Charley Parr and he says "Charley", - this was Mr. Sam
Woods I wrote to,- he will testify the same thing; he said "Charley,
in the name of my sick sister, who is almost at the point of death
and had been for a long time, I want you to let Dr. Waters return to
Athens ff he don't do a thing in the world but attend to her and go
straight back home." "No". He wrote me this. I didn't have any
communication. Mr. Woods wrote me this. Charley said he can't come
back here " I am going to kill him if he comes on the streets of
Athens." That is the reason I told bol.Shackelford and Judge West
I wouldn't return just now. But I came there with the expectation of
doing it but decided best not to do it. As I say, I was at home at
my brother's or at my mother's in constant communication with my-
wife and other friends here in town all the time from hhe 17th day
of March until the day I started to return to Athens, except the 30th
and 29th or 30th, or the two days, Saturday and Sunday that I was
coming, which was the 28th and 30th, I think, the 29th and 30th that
I was on my way to Chattanooga and returning. I was at one of my
brothers or my mothers all the time. I told my attorneys to tell the
sheriff and to tell the Solicitor that if they, he or either of them,
113


-54-
wanted me at any time to come before any court to let me know and
I would be here. I went on. I was back home. On the 3rd day of
May I was advised of the action of the grand jury in this case and
to return. I left Lebanon, Tennessee, I think it was on the 3rd
or 4th, whatever it was, and to arrived in Athens on May 5th at ten
o'clock on the Seaboard train from Atlanta, and I got in a cab
with Judge Vest, I think, and Probably Col. Shackelford, and I
came right straight to the court house and when I got out of the
cab I met your Honor and Frank Rhodes standing on the street and
I said "good morning, Judge, I want to see the sheriff.
That was
on the 5th day of May.
I have been in the custody of the sheriff
since.
Now, gentlemen, let me refer back just a little
bit, I graduated in my proffession in 1902. I came to Georgia. I
have a license. In my license, recognized by the state, special
act of the Legislature authorizing me to practice my profession of
osteopathy,- it is in my license, osteopathy and its subjects,
su gery and obstetrics. Now, gentlemen, the law requires that a
man's license shall be recorded with the Clerk of the Court. My
license are on record in this court house with the Clerk and if you
doubt my veracity or my license, call on him and he will show you
that my license are registered here, - that they gave to me from the
act of the Legislature the right to practice osteopathy in this
state, to practice surgery in this state and to practice obstetrics
in this state.
Now, gentlemen, briefly, I know you all are
tired of this. That is what I know regarding this case.
But I
want to reiterate to you one statement that when that girl talked
to me and in our conversation and in my actions with her, so far
as I knew of that girl's pregnancy, and so far as I knew there


-55-
was any wrongdoing of that girl, she was as pure as a snowdrift
from Heaven.
I thank you for attention.

This Motion and amendment thereto came to be heard
this day in vacation under an order pranted in term.
Treating the motion and amendment thereto as con-
struing a valid motion for new trial, it is ordered that the mot
tion be overruled and a new trial refused.
This order refusing a new trial is based upon two
reasons.
ist. The motion and amendment are nulities as they
seek to set aside only a portion of ansingle iverdict and this
can not be done by Motion for new trial. Such a motion sets aside
the entire verdict, a verdict is not separable in a case like
the present.

THE STATE)
VS.
Clarke Superior Court, April Adjourned Term,
1919, Presentment for Murder, etc., and
Presentment of Guilty of Involuntary Man-
slaughter in the Commission of an Unlawful
Act.
W. G. WATHRS
CHARGE OF THE COURT.
Gentlemen of the Jury:
The grand jury of this county have
returned a presentment against W. G. Waters and M. T. Summerlin. The
indictment contains what we call in law three counts, - that is, the
defendants are charged with three offenses in different parts of the
indictment. The first count charges them with the offense of murder;
the second count charges them with the offense of involuntary man-
slaughter in the commission of an unlawful act, and the third count
charges them with assault with intent to murder. To this presentment
the defendant, W. G. Vaters, has filed his plea of not guilty, and he
is alone on trial at this time. This plea' of not guilty applies to
all three of the counts, - that is, he says by his plea that he is
not guilty of any of the offenses charged in the indictment and this
plea makes the issues for you to determine.
The law presumes every person to be
innocent of crime until his guilt has been established in the manner
prescribed by law, and this presumption of innocence remains with a
man throughout his trial until it is overcome by evidence which satis-
fies the mind and the conscience of the jury of the guilt of the
accused beyond a reasonable doubt,
I charge you that under the third count,
which charges the defendant with the offense of assault with intent
to murder, there can be no conviction under that count, unless the
evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the child was at
the time of the alleged crime quick, - that is, had reached that
stage of development in its mother's womb that it had noved therein.
The Solicitor-General does not ask a verdict at your hands on the
118


third count and, therefore, I will confine my instructions to you
to the law which relates to the first and second count in the
indictment.
The first count charges the defendants with the offense
of murder for that the said W. G. Waters and M. T. Summerlin on the
20th day of February in the year 1919, in the county and state afore-
said, did then and there unlawfully and with force and arms, in and
upon one Viola Parr, in the peace of God and said state, unlawfully,
feloniously and willfully, and of their malice aforethought, did kill
and murder, by then and there using and employing a certain instrument
and instruments to the grand jurors unknown by inflicting in and on
the person of said Viola Parr a mortal wound, of which mortal wound
the said Viola Parr died; and the grand jurors upon their oaths
aforesaid do say that the said W. G. Waters and M. T. Summerlin the
said Viola Parr in the manner and form aforesaid unlawfbilly, felonious-
ly and willfully and of their malice aforethought did kill and murder,
contrary to the laws of said state, the good order, peace and dignity
thereof.
Homicide is of three kinds, - murder, manslaughter and
justifiable homicide. Homicide is the killing of a human being.
Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, in the
peace of the State, by a person of sound memory and discretion, with
malice aforethought, either express or implied. The law presumes
every person to be of sound mind until the contrary appears.
Express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully
to take away the life of a fellow-creature, which is manifested by
external circumstances capable of proof.
Malice shall be implied, says the law, where no consid-
erable provocation appears and where all the circumstances of the
killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.
A crime consists in the violation of a public law, in the
commission of which there shall be a union or joint operation of act
and intention, or criminal negligence,
Intention will be manifested by the circumstaces con-
nected with the perpetration of the offense, and the sound mind and
119


#3.
discretion of the person accused.
The comission of an unlawful act which in its conse-
quences naturally tends to destroy the life of a human being is
deened and adjudged by the law to be murder.
The second count of the presentment charges, and the
grand jurors aforesaid, in the name and behalf of the citizens of
Georgia, do further charge and accuse the said W. G. Waters and M. T.
Summerlin with the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the commissio
of an unlawful act, for that the said W. G. Waters and II. T. Summer-
lin, in the county and state aforesaid, on the 20th day of February,
in the year of our Lord, 1919, with force and arms and without any
intention to do so, but in the commission of an unlawful act, did
unlawfully, feloniously and willfully kill Viola Parr, the said
Viola Parr being at the time a pregnant woman, by then and there
using and employing an instrument and instruments to the grand jurors
unknown, which said instrument and instruments were by the said W. G.
Waters and 11. T. Summerlin used and employed for the purpose and with
the intent thereby to produce the miscarriage and abortion of the
said Viola Parr, and by the use and employment of said instrument
and instruments on the person of the said Viola Parr did thereby cause
and produce the miscarriage and abortion of said Viola Parr and did
ther eby kill the said Viola Parr, the use and employment of said
instrument and instruments not being then and the re necessary to
preserve the life of the said Viola Parr and not having been ad-
vised by two physicians to be necessary for that purpose; said W. G.
Waters and M. T. Summerlin in the manner and form aforesaid the said
Viola Parr did unlawfully, feloniously and willfully kill, contrary
to the laws of said state, the good, order, peace and dignity thereof.
Involuntary manslaughter shall consist in the killing of
a human being without any intention to do so, but in the commission
of an unlawful act, provided that were such involuntary killing shall
happen in the commission of an unlawful act which, in its consequence,
naturally tends to destroy the life af a human being, the offense shall
be deemed and adjudged to be murder.
120


The law provides that any person who shall willfully
administer to any pregnant woman any medicine, drug, or substance,
or any thing whatever, or shall employ any instrument or means what-
ever, with intent thereby to produce the miscarriage or abortion of
any such woman, unless the same shall have been necessary to pre-
serve the life of such woman, or shall have been advised by two
physicians to be necessary for that purpose, shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor.
I charge you that any person who violates the provisions
of that section of the code that I have just read commits an unlawful
act, and I charge you further that it is an unlawful act no matter
at what stage the foetus in the mother's womb may be, and it is not
necessary in order to constitute a violation of that section that the
child should be quick or have arrived at that stage of development
in its mother's womb where it moved. But one who does the things
which have been prohibited in that section of the code for the
purpose of producing a miscarriage or abortion violates that without
regard to the age of the foetus in the mother's womb, All that is
necessary to be established is that there was a foetus in the womb
of some age and these acts were done for the purpose of producing a
miscarriage or abortion.
I, therefore, charge you that if one violates that pro-
vision of the code, which I have just read, and commits the unlawful
act therein provided, and as a consequence of that unlawful act the
death of the mother results, that that would consitute the offense
of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlar ful act.
A person may be principal in an offense in two degrees.
A principal in the first degree is the actor or absolute perpetrator
of the crime. A principal in the second degree is he who is present,
aiding and abetting the act to be done, which presence need not be
always an actual immediate standing by, within sight of hearing of the
act; but there may be in law a constructive presence.
Evidence is of two kinds, direct and circumstantial.
Direct evidence is that which immediately points to the question
121


at issue, Cirčumstantial evidence is that which only tends to
establish the issue by proof of various facts sustaining by their
consistency the hypothesis claimed.
To warrant a conviction or circumstantial evidence the
proved facts must not only be consistent with the hypothesis of guilt
but must exdude every other reasonable hypothesis save that of the
guilt of the accused.
Whether dependent upon positive or circumstantial evi-
dence, the true question in a criminal case is not whether it be
possible that the conclusion at which the testimony points may be
false, but whether there is sufficient testimony to satisfy the
mind and conscience beyond a reasonable doubt.
The law does not expect mathematical certainty in legal
investigations for the reason that it is not attainable, and all that
the law requires in a legal investigation is moral and reasonable
certainty. But in criminal cases the law requires that degree of
moral and reasonable certainty which satisfies the mind and conscience
of the jury of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
You are instructed that it is for the Court in the first
instance to determine whether the preliminary proof is sufficient to
admit dying declarations, but this ruling is not binding upon you,
for you must be satisfied that such statement was actually made by
the deceased and that she was in the article of death and conscious
of her condition at the time of making the declaration.
Our Code provides, dying declarations, made by any person
in the article of death, who is conscious of his condition, as to
the cause of his death, and the person who killed him, are admissible
in evidence in a prosecution for the homicide.
Great caution is necessary in the admision and use of
this kind of testimony. It is not necessary that the person whose
statements are sought to be introduced should express himself or
herself as believing that he or she is in a dying condition.
Consciousness of the condition of the person who is alleged to have
made the statements may be inferred from the nature of the wound,
122


#6.
or from other circumstances. Dying declarations, when the jury is
satisfied that they are such, are founded on the necessity of the
case and the reason being that being made in view of impend ing
death and judgment, when the hope of life is extinct and when the
retributions of externity are at hand, they stand on the same plane
of solemity as statements made under oath.
Flight, if proven to the satisfaction of the jury and
beyond a reasonable doubt, may be considered by the jury along with
theother evidence in the case for the jury to determine whether such
flight and the circumstances under which it occurred were sufficient
for the jury to draw an inference that the flight was the result of
conscious guilt. But flight is subject to explanation. The weight
to be given it, or whether the jury will draw an inference of
consciousness of guilt or not is a matter for the jury. It is for
the jury to determine whether the flight of the defendant was due to
a sense of guilt or to other reasons, If for other reasons no
inference burtful to the accused must be drawn by the jury.
When witnesses appear and testify they are presumed to
speak the truth and it is the duty of the jury to believe then, unless
they have been impeach ed in some of the methods known to the lay, or
are otherwise discredited in the minds of the jury. A witness may be
impeached by disproving the facts testified to by the witness, but
where a witness is thus sought to be impeached the witness may be
sustained by facts and circumstances appearing in the case, or by
evidence which satisfies the jury that the witness attacked is telling
the truth.
It is the duty of the jury to reconcile the testimony
in the case and to do this without imputing perjury to any witness
and without input ing a false statement to the accused. But, if in your
investigation of the evidence in the case you reach a conflict that
you can not reconcile, then it is your duty to believe that witness
or those witnesses that you think best entitled to belief, and in
determining what witnesses you will believeor disbelieve you are
authorized to take into consideration the demeanor of the witness on
123


on the stand, the relation of the witness to the case, the interest
of the witness in the result of the case, the reasonableness or
unreasonableness of the testimony given by the witness, the proba-
bility or improbability of the testimony given by the witness, the
prejudice or bias of the witness, if any has appeared, and the personal
credibility of the witness, so far as the same has legitimately appeare
during the progress of the present trial. But the jury are at last
the sole and the exlusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses
and the weight to be given their testimony.
The defendant has made a statement in this case, which
the law gave him a right to do. The law provides that in all criminal
trials the accused may take to the court and jury just such statement
as he sees proper in his own defense. It is not under oath, he is not
subject to be cross-examined unless he consents to be cross-examined.
But the jury ere authorized, if they see proper to do so, to believe
the statement of the accused in preference to the sworn testimony.
The weight to be given the statement of the accused is a matter
entirely for your consideration and determination. You may believe
it all, if you see proper to do so, or you may disbelieve it all, or
you may believe it in part and disbelieve it in part.
Conspiracy consists in a corrupt agreement between two or
more persons to do an unlawful act, unlawful either as to means or
as to end. This agreement may be established by direct proof or by
inference as a deduction from conduct which discloses a common design
on the part of the persons charged to act together for the accomplish-
ment of the unlawful purpose. This question is for the jury to settle,
that is, whether or not a conspirace has or has not been established.
is solely for the jury to determine.
If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt from the
evidence that a conspiracy has been established, then I charge you
that everything that was said or done by any of the persons whom you
are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt were in the conspidacy from
the time that the conspiracy was formed, during its progress, while
the unlawful act was being carried into execution, and until the
124


#8.
purpose for which the conspiracy was formed has been accomplished
would be evidence against each of the conspirators. But if the
purposes of the conspiracy have been accomplished and the criminal
enterprise, if there is such, is at ån end, then from that time each
of the alleged conspirators speak only and act only for themselves
and not for the other.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that in a criminal
case the jury are the judges of the law and the fact, and they are
required to render a general verdict of guilty or not guilty, but I
charge you further that it is your duty to receive the law as given
you in charge by the court and to follow the instructions of the judge
on the law involved in the case. The facts you determine for your-
selves from the evidence and from the prisoner's statement, but the
law you take from the court.
Now, gentlemen of the jury, apply these rules of law
which I have given you to the evidence and the pisoner's statement
and reach your conclusion as to what you believe to be the truth of
the case. If, after giving due consideration to all of the evidence
and theprisoner's statement, you reach the conclusion beyond a
reasonable doubt that the defendant, Waters, now on trial, is guilty
of murder, you would be authorized so to find, and in that event
the form of your verdict would be, we, the jury, find the defendant
W. G. Waters, guilty of rurder under the first count. Now, the punish-
ment of murder is death, unless the jury change it. When a jury con-
victs a person of murder, the law allows the jury, if they see proper
to do so, the change the punishment from death to imprisonment in the
penitentiary for life. The lae gives you this discretion. You may
exercise this discretion for any reason that is satisfactory to your
minds. Now, if you find the defendant guilty of murder and see proper
to exercise the discretion which the law gives you to chance the
penalty from death to imprisonment for life, then the form of your
verdict would be, we, the jury, find the defendant, W. G. Vaters,
guilty of murder under the first count and recomiend that he be
imprisoned in the penitentiary for life.
125


On the other hand, if you do not believe that the defend-
ant, W. G. Waters, is guilty of murder, of if you have a reasonable
doubt on your minds as to vihether he is guilty of murder, you would
be authorized to acquit him, and in that event the form of your
verdict would be, we, the jury, find the defendant, W. G. Waters,
not guilty of murder under the first count,
Hacing disposed of the first count in the indictment by
whatever verdict you may find under the instruction which I have
given you as applied to the evidence and the prisoner's statement,
then you enter into your deliberations upon the second count, which
charges the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the cormission of
an unlawful act. If, after giving due consideration to all the evi-
dence and the prisoner's statement, you reach the conclusion that the
defendant is guilty of that offense beyond a reasonable doubt, you
would be authorized so to find, and in that event the form of your
verdict would be, we, the jury, find the defendant, W. G. Waters,
guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful
act under the second count.
On the other hand, if you are not satisfied of his guilt,
under that count, or if you have a reasonable doubt on your minds as
to his guilt under that count, you would be authorized to acquit him,
and in that event the form of your verdict would be, we, the jury,
find the defendant, W. G. Waters, not guilty of involuntary manslaughte
in the commission of an unlawful act under the second count.
I charge you, gentlement of the jury, that under the
first count, which charges murder, that you must be satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt before you can convict under that count that either
there was an intent to kill, or such criminal negligence as that the
jury would infer or supply from the circumstances the intent which the

law requires, or unless you believe beyond a reasonable doubt
that if death resulted from an unlawful act that that unlawful
act was one which in its consequences naturally tended to the
destruction of human life.
I charge you that under the second count that a conviction
may be lawfully had although there was no intention to kill, if you
believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the unlawful act alleged in
the count has been proven, the law would authorize a conviction under
that count, even if there was no intention to kill at the time the
alleged unlawful act was alleged to have been performed.
Those counts, therefore, are of such a nature that it
would not be legally possible for the jury to find the defendant
guilty on both counts and, therefore, I charge you that if you find
the defendant guilty under the first count, you find him not guilty
under the second count; and if you find him not guilty under the
first count, then determine whether you will find him guilty or not
guilty under the second count. There must be a finding by the jury
on each of the counts in order. On the first count make your finding,
whatever it may be, in reaching your conclusions, under the rules
that I have given you. Under the second count, reach your con-
clusions andmake your finding under the rules which I have given you.
After you have done this, your finding on the third count
will be, we, the jury, find the defendant, W. G. Waters, not guilty
under the third count, as the Solicitor does not insist on a con-
viction under that count, and I charge you that the evidence is not
sufficient to convict under that count.
Now, gentlemen of the jury, the time has arrived when you
may take the presentment and enter upon your deliberations and con-
sider your verdict.
