W, G. WATERS
Plaintiff in Error.
COURT OF APPEALS OF GEORGIA
vs.
STATE OF GEORGIA
Def endant in Error.
Term, 1919.
BILL OF EXCEPTIONS.
BE IT RHMEMBERED That on the 20th day of
May, 1919, in the Superior Court of Clarke County, Georgia,
there came on to be tried the case of the State vs. W. G. Waters,
the same being a presentment in said Court charging the said
W, G. Waters and M. T. Summerlin in the first count with murder,
in the second count with involuntary manslaughter in the commission
of an unlawful act, and in the third count with assault with intent
to murder. The said M. T. Summerlin having elected to sever and
having already been tried, the said W. G. Waters was alone put upon
trial und er said presentment.
Upon the 20th day of May, 1919, the defendant,
W. G, Waters, before arraignment and before pleading to said pre-
sentment, presented and filed his demurrer to sa id presentment and
after argument of counsel the Judge overruled said demurrer, and
entered an order thereon overruling the same. On the same day,
to-wit, May 20th, 1919, defendant filed his exceptions pendente
lite thereto, which were certified by the Judge, allowed, and made
a part of the record, the exceptions therein being stated, and upon
which plaintiff in error then and there excepted and now excepts and
assigns error thereon as being contrary to law, and says that the
Judge should have sustained said demurrer upon each and all of the
grounds therein contained.
Upon the overruling of said demurrer and
before entering upon the trial of said case, the defendant, W. G.
Waters, moved the Court that the State, through the Solicitor-
General, be required to elect upon which count in the presentment


Page #2.
the said W. G. Waters should be tried und er. The Court then and
there refused to require the State to elect and allowed the trial
to proceed against the defendant upon all three of the counts in
the presentment, to which overruling of the Court the defendant
then and there excepted and now excepts and assigns error upon the
same, upon the ground that said presentment charged three separate
and distinct crimes and the third count was not in the class of
series of the first two counts, and also upon the gound that one
of said counts, to-wit, the third count, charged a misdemeanor,
and that this count could not be joined with the counts charging
a felony without an election on the part of the State.
Said demurrer and said motion to elect having
been overruled, said case proceed ed to trial, and the jury having
been stricken, the evidence was introduced by the State and defend ant
made his statement, and after argument of counsel and the charge of
the Court, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendant not
guilty of murder as under the first count, guilty of involuntary
manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act as under the
second count, and not guilty of assault with intent to murder as
und er the third count. Upon the verdict finding defendant guilty
of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act,
his Honor, Andrew J. Cobb, Judge of said Court, then and there
presiding, sentenced the defend ant, W. G. Waters, to serve a term
of three years in the penitentiary.
Said defendant thereafter and within the time
prescribed by law, filed his motion for a new trial, filed his
brief of evidence therein and his amended motion for a new trial,
all of which were approved and certified as true by the said Judge,
and the said motion for new trial was set for a hearing on June
21st, 1919, at which time said motion coming on for a hearing
before the said presiding Judge, the Honorable Andrew J. Cobb,


Page #3.
Judge of said Court, when and whereupon after argument thereon
the said Judge overruled said motion and refused to grant a new
trial therein, to which judgment so over-ruling said motion,
defendant then and there excepted and now excepts and assigns
said ruling and judgment as error, as being contrary to law, and
says that the said Judge should have granted said motion upon each
and all of the grounds therein taken and set out.
The defendant, W. G. Waters, names himself herein
as the plaintiff in error, and he names the State of Georgia as
the defendant in error in this bill of exceptions.
Plaintiff in error comes on this the day of
July, 1919, and within the time prescribed by law, and presents
to the Honorable Andrew J. Cobb, Judge of said Court, whqpresided
in said case, this his bill of exceptions and asks that the same be

SD Indictment in Clarke Superior Court, Murder
W.G.WATERS AND
M.T. SUMMERLIN.
Ở Involuntary Manslaughter, Assault with In-
I tent to Murder.
Now Comes W.G.Waters, one of the defendants in the
above named and stated case, and before arraignment and before
pleading to the presentment thereon, and demurs thereto, and for
grounds of demurrer, says:
Ist. This defendant denurs to said presentment upon
the grounds that the allegations therein do not charge this de-
fendant with any offense under the law, and under the allegations
therein the defendant is not guilty of any offense under the
laws of this state.
2nd. This defendant denure to said presentment upon
the grounds that there is no offense under the laws of this
State charged against defendant therein, and the allegations
of said presentment do not set out and charge an offense under
the laws of this state against defendant.
3rd. This defendant d murs to said presentment upon
the ground that the allegations therein are not sufficient to
charge this defendant with a violation of any offense under the
laws of this State, and said presentment is wholly insufficient
in law.
4th. This defendant especially demurs to the first
count of said presentment, wherein the State attempts to charge
the defendant with murder, upon the following grounds, to-wit:
(a) There is no language in said Count charging that
de fendant used any weapon likely to produce death. If it had
been charged that such a weapon had been used, intention could
be presumed, nor is it charged that said "Instrument and instru-
ments" were used in a manner calculated to cause death.
(b) There is no charge in said count of the present-
ment containing the two (2) negatives set forth in Sections 81
and 82 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910 in reference to
abortion; it not being stated that the abortion of the said
Viola Parr was not necessary to save her life, nor that it was


done without the advice of two (2) physicians. It was necessary
to charge in this count these two negatives, for the reason that t
all three of the counts describe the one transaction, same time,
place, person and death, and counts two and three set out in
detail the facts, and these facts being such as to describe and
charge an abobtion as contained in Section 81 of the Penal Code
of Georgia of 1910. That while murder is formally charged in
the first count, all the facts alleged to make any crime are se t
forth in the second and third counts.
(c) That the charges and allegations in said count of
the presentments are too vague and indefinite, and fail to put
the defendant upon notice as to what specific conduct he has
been guilty of; how and where any mortal wound was given. The
only language being, "Did kill and murder by then and there using
and employing a certain instrument and instruments to the Grand
Jurors unknown, by inflicting in and on the person of said Viola
Parr a Mortal wound". That said language is too vague and does
not sufficiently describe the manner in which any instrument
was used, how any wound was inflicted, and where. The said lan-
guage does not put the defendant on Notice of the details of
the charge, and how and in what manner, and under what circumstan-
ces he could have or did commit the offense of murder.
5th. The defendant especially demurs to the second
Count of said presentment upon the following grounds, to-wit:
(a) That the allagetions of the second count of said
presentment are insufficient in law to constitute a valid pre-
sentment for the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the
commission of an unlawful act.
(b) Beca use the allegations of the second count of
said presentment show that if any offense is alleged thereby,
it is not the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the com-
mission of an unlawful act, but the offense punished as assault
with intent to murder by Section 81 of the Penal Code of Georgid.
of 1910.
(c) That the allegations made in the Second count char-
ging involuntary manslaughter are too vague and indefinite, ard
do not put defendant on notice as to how the said Viola Parr was


killed, there is no allegation that any wound was given, how any
instrument was used, whether in a deadly manner or not, the only
charge being that instruments were used to create an abortion
and not to kill. The charge being that an abortion was produced,
"and did there by kill the said Viola Parr". If killed by the in-
strument, it is not alleged d finitely, and if killed by the abor-
tion, it is not alleged how the abortion killed, and in what manner
death was produced.
6th. The defendant especially demurs to the third
count upon the following grounds, to-wit:
(a) That the defendant, contrary to law, is charged in
the Third Count, under sections 81 or 82 of the Penal Code of Geor-
gia of 1910,with abortion, said count being for assault with in-
tent to murder, in the same present which charges him in sepera te
counts with murder and involuntary manslaughter. The Three of-
fenses charged, in the three seperate counts, being all based upon
the same identical facts, and the said three offenses not be-
longing to a series, but being entirely seperate offenses,with
sepe rate punishments for each.
(b) That the third Count being based upon the same iden-
tical facts, and said facts constituting under section 81 of the
Penal Code of Georgia, og 1910, a specific offense, cannot be char-
ged in three seperate counts as three seperate offenses, but can
only be charged as one offense, and that offense the one designated
by statute, to-wit: Section 81 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910,
assault with intent to murder.
(c) That the third count is not alleged that the child
was a living child, or what is common known as "Quick", and that un-
der section 81 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910 it is necessary
to allege and prove that the child was"quick" in order to consti-
tute a felony as defined by section 81. That if said child was
nattaquick" child the facts set out in the third count would charge
only a misdemeanor, as contained in section 82 of the Penal Code of
Georgia of 1910.
(a) That the allegations contained in the third count
are not sufficient to charge assault with intent to murder, a felo-
ny, for the reason that it is not charged that the child alleged to
have been destroyed was a "Quick" Child or that it was a living


child and that, although said count attempted to charge a felony,
in fact it only charged a misdemeanor, the misdemeanor charge be-
ing that described in Section 88 of the Penal Code of Georgia,
1910. That the third count therefore charging a misdemeanor is
illegally joined with the first and second Count of said pre se nt-
ment, each of which charges a felony, and under the rule, it is not
permissible in the same presentment to join felonies and Misde -
meanors.
(e) That the entire presentment should be quashed unless
the State shall elect whether it will proceed under the first
two counts of said presentment or under the third count.
(f) That inethe third count it is not charged or al-
leged that the child died, or was destroyed by the use of any in-
strument, nor is it charged that the life of said child was des-
troyed at all, this being a necessary allegation under section
81 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910.
WHEREFORE, defendant prays that each and all of the
foregoing grounds of demurrer be examined into by the Court, and
that the said presentment be quashed upon each and all of said
grounds, and that this defendant be not required to plead further
thereto.
