In Re, Application of Dr.M.T. Summerlin
for Pardon.
May 5th.,1921.
Honorable Prison Commission,
Atlanta, Georgia.
Gentlemen:-
I notice by the press that Dr.M.T. Summerlin
of Athens Georgia has filed application with your Honorable
Board for four consideration, and I hasten to write and
add to the many endorsements in his behalf my endorsement
for a pardon for him, and I trust that your Honorable body
can see your way clear to pass favorably upon his application,
and reccommend to the governor that he be pardoned.
I have known the applicant from child-hood, and he
comes from one of the very best famildes in this state, and
has always born a good character, and has always lived above
reproach, and I am loathe to believe him guilty of the crime
as charged, in fact there seems to be grave doubt of his guilt,
and he and his good family have already suffered untold
agonies on account of the charge made against him.
He was born and raised here in south Georgia, and lived
to manhood in this section, and his friends all over south
Georgia would be pleased beyond expression for hime to re-
ceive an unconditional pardon, and I earnestly reccommend that
you give his application favorable consideration.

Yours very truly, (GAR

To Whom It May Concern:-
I have known Dr. T. Sumerlin for the
past ten years all of which time I have been closely associated
with him as an intimate friend. In this period of time I have had
ample opportunity to weigh him as one man would weigh an other,
and judge of his character, his habits and his general demeanor
toward his fellow man, and from my knowledce of him I say I am
qualified to make the assertion "he is a ran worth knowing and
having known him feel benefited by his clean cut man-hood.
I knew Dr.Summerlin before he became a
husband and father, and admired his clean living, his agressiviness
and his attentiveness to business, his high regard for those
about him, and his love for his friends.
I know Dr.Swameriin as a husband and father.
I know no man who has a greater love for his wife and babies. I know
of no man who has put forth greater effort cr has strived with any
more determination to reke the life of those loved ones, one of
happiness and contentment. He has surrounded thera with love, and the
attentions that are begotten by love, respect and esteem, of his home
life too much can not be said.
I am a Blue Lodge Mason and an Elk. I am the
husband of the "Sweetest mother! on earth and the proud Daddy of
three of the "Finest Kiddies" in existence. I am selfsish enough to
think my " Home'l is paramount above all others and because of this
belief I want my friends to enjoy it with me. Dr.Suwerline is
welcome in my "Home" at any and all times, and he will be welcome
not only by me alone, but by Mrs. Heidler and the three "babiesh as
well. A man can pay no greater tribute to a man, if both be men.
I am writing this unsolicited, es pressing
the sentiments of my heart, the devotion of a friend, the something
that exists between men as existed between Damon and Pythias, in the
Hope I might be of some help to Dr.Summerlin in this crisis of his
life.

Gentlemen:-
.
This is to certify that I have known Dr. W. T
Summerlin since he first became a citizen of Athens, about
twelve years ago.
He has always conducted himself as a gentlemen
and won the confidence and resrect of the people of our city.
He is capable lentisi and servedl Athens weil in his pro-
fession, building up a very large practice.
Notwithstanding his unfortunate experience he
still holds the respect and sympathy of the best people of
city.
I am sure it would meet the approval of the people
of Athens and vicinity, should your honorable body see fit to
grant him pardon thereby allowing him to return to his family
and profession.
Yours very truly,

Centlemen:-
I take pleasure in statin, herein the following facts concernin, Dr. Marie T. Sum-
Yerlin:
2. I have known Dr.Summerling since he began the practice of Dentistry in our
city, and during the most of this time I have known him and his family rather intimately.
Dr. Summerling during this time was the chosen Dentist for my family and mysell.
2. It is my earnest conviction that during the years of his practice of Dentistry
in this city, he was one of the most popular and charitable and xromisin, youn, men in
our city.
3. I have been associated with Dr. Summerlin in fraternal orders and have been
with him, sleeping in the room with him, on a hunt in South Georgia several inters wo,
and I have remarked, before and since his trouble, that he manifested none of that i11thi-
ness of conversation that often characterizes men; and that he always seemed to me to
be clean in his converaation and I have spent five iays, on two different occasions,
hunting near Sparks, ca., where Dr. Summerling was reared, once before his imprisonment
and once since, and I have made it my business to make inguiry among the people anons
who he was reaped, asto his life previous to his coming to Athens, and they have in
each case asserted that they were greatly shocked and suprised at his present trouble
because he had lived such a clean life previously and had never been in trouble before
of any kind.
4. If the desire is to have him wunished, he has been uunished, it seems to me, to
the full:His raidly growing assets have been dissipated and wrecked; he has been huiliete
and publically condemned at the hands of the law; and his family have guffered an irre-
sarable injury, and his wife is a nervous wreck.
5. If his statement to me was true, he is being punished for a crime that he was not
suilty of.

Cphtice

Gentlemen:-
In behalf of Dr. M. T. Summerlin, I
desire to make the following statement.
I have known Dr. Summerlin profes-
ionally since he first came to Athens, twelve or
thirteen years ago. He has been my family dentist
since that time. I consider him far above the aver-
age as a dentist. He is conscientous and painstaking
in his work and has applied himself faithfully and
earnestly to his porfession. His patrons are of the
best people in this community.
I have also known Dr. Summerlin in a
business way and have found him strictly honest and
trustworthy.
His abscence has been a loss to the com-
munity and I would consider his return an acquisition.
