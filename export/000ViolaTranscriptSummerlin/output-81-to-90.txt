UPSON HARPER, sworn for the State, testified,
as follows:
I have charge of the Southern Mutual Building.
I don't know whether Dr. Summerlin has been there
since the 1st day of March or not. I couldn't tell
you to save my life what date it was. I remember the
day he was said to have fainted on the elevator, but
not the date. I don't think I have seen him there
since that time. I am not sure. I have talked with
him over the telephone.
UPSON HARPER was not cross examined.

M. T. SUMMERLIN, defendant, statement :
Gentlemen of the Jury and Gentlemen: I
want to say in the start that I knew nothing of the
operation whatever performed by Dr. Waters at my office.
Miss Parr did not consult or ask permission to use my
office. I knew absolutely nothing about it until
Sunday morning that Dr. Holliday performed his operation
at the house that I was giving gas that she ever had
anything done at my office previous to that. Miss Parr
had been working for me, I believe, since about the first
of June. She came to the office with a cousin of her's
that was having work done.
This cousin made two or
three visits there and Miss Parr was a visitor at the
time she was there, and talking with the cousin of Miss
Parr, - she knew I had lost one girl through moving away
from the town, and she asked me if we needed another
girl,” said Miss Parr was not working at that time and
had been working at the telephone exchange. We soon come
to terms and she went to work and worked continually up
until the 20th df February, I believe was the day they
claim she had this operation. I was not connected with
Dr. Waters and knew absolutely nothing of his coming to
the office. I knew nothing of the condition of Miss Parr
being pregnant and I knew nothing of her trying to get
Dr. Waters to come there to do this operation. Furthermore
I didn't have any connection whatever with the case. On
Sunday morning, when I was out here to give the
anaesthetic for Dr. Holliday, she told me she had had
this dilation made but she did not say by whom or at
what time. I didn't know then at what time she had it
done, but she said she had it done in my offi e in the
X-ray room. Now, I have four rooms in the Southern
Mutual Building; I have a location in the northwest corner
and the X-ray room is on one side of the sitting room
68


#26.
and two rooms on the opposite side, one room being in
the corner; this room on the left hand side of the
sitting room is the one we use for the X-ray room. In
that room we have an operating table, - that is, we have
a table there for placing people for making X-rays for
different medical doctors that bring cases there that
require to be laid down.
This is the room that she has
reference to of using. The other part of the office is
absolutely no tables or nothing she could have to use.
I want to say further that it is absolutely untrue that
I had any connection with the case and that I had bound
Miss Parr by secrecy in the case to keep a pledge not to
telliit. I knew of no such operation and therefore I
would not pledge her. I has been stated that I carried
Miss Parr home. That is wrong. Miss Parr left the
office about two-thirty, the afternoon of this day they
claim this operation was performed. I was to go to
Atlanta to a Shrine meeting that afternoon but on accou nt
of rain we didn't go, but we had made no engagement for
the afternoon; we agreed both of the girls should leave
the office that afternoon. That was the plan for me to
be gome and that they should take the afternoon off.
They
both left and Miss Parr left at two-thirty and I never
saw her no more. I returned from dinner at that hour and
after
I never saw her no more until Sunday morning, that at her
home and I was called to her home at her mother's request
to give the aneasthetic for Dr. Holliday, and at that
time I knew nothing of her condition and did not know
what operation was to be performed. But in this con-
versation before Dr. Holliday came she told me she had
had a little operation performed at the office on
69


#27.
Thursday and hadn't been back to the office Friday and
Saturday on that account,- that Dr. Holliday had
advised this operation and thought it was necessary and
thought she would get out in a few days. That is the
only thing I know in connection with this case.
Now, about the fainting on the first of March,
Saturday, the 1st. I had been sick and if I become
bilious I always faint; I have had a record of that.
Every spring, I become bilious and if I let it go too
far it gets the better of me. A year ago I fainted at
home and had to have a nurse to help put me in until I
got over it. At this time I had been lounging around the
officejust doing the work to relieve pain, just as little
as I could, - cases that had to be attended to. I had
been dying around practically for three or four days but
not doing regular work. We hadn't seen over twn or
fifteen patients a day. When Dr. Holliday phoned me he
took me by surprise. I never heard of such a thing. He
said her brothers was coming after me with their guns and
for me to get out and protect myself. He warned me in
time so I wouldn't be caught napping, - for me to look out
for myself. I had been vaccinated and had a terrible
vaccination for small-pox and my arm was so sore I
couldn't hardly lift it to my head. At this time as I
started down the elevator I fainted and was lifted out
of the elevator at the base of the building in the bobby
and they carried me home. I did not run away from Athens.
I went off on the ad vi se of my physician and I did not
leave Athens until the Thursday following this fainting
on Saturday. The next Thursday I went away to avoid a
collision with the Parrs, knowing that they were very
bad against me at that time and not knowing better that
to wait until they could get more information and know
more about it and not be so violent against me. So, I
left and came back two weeks after that. I came back in


#28.
the day time and stayed for a week but on advice of frieds
I did not think it was best to antagonize the Parrs and
I stayed around the house and saw a number of friends
back and forth and did not run from anybody.
I passed
two of the Barr bays on Sunday afternoon after I come
backright close to the side walk in front of my house.
And I went away a week from that and went to New York
and took a post-graduate course for a month and as quick
as I found out about the indictment, as quick as I could
close up my school work, I came back and surrendered
voluntarily to the Sheriff to stand trial, and I have
been in the custody of the Sheriff ever since.
MRS. C. W. FILLINGHAM, recalled for the State, testified
as follows:
I remember the occasion that Dr. Summerlin
came out to Mrs. Parr's on Sunday morning for the
purpose of administering gas for I was there at the
time. He was not alone with Miss Parr at any time
during that; he didn't even come in the room until after
Dr. Holliday was in theroom and he sit in the living
room during the whole time we were preparing the room
and also while we were preparing the girl for the operation.
I was in the room with the girl, and he didn't have any
conversation with Miss Parr in which she stated to him
about having an operation performed.

VS.
Clarke Superior Court
W.G.WATERS, AND
M.T.SUMMERLIN.
8 April Term, 1919.
This Motion and amendment thereto came on to be heard
this day in vacation under an order granted in term.
Treating the motion and amendment thereto as constitu-
ting a valid Motion for new trial, it is ordered that the motion be
overruled and a new trial refused.
This order refusing a new trial is based upon two reasons.
1st. The motion and amendment are nullities as they seek
to set aside only a portion of a single verdict and this cannot be
done by motion for new trial, such a motion sets aside the entire ver-
dict, a verdict is not seprable in a case like the present.
2nd. Each and every ground of the motion and amendment
is without it merit
