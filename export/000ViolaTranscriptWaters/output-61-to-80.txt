any wrong doing of that girl, she was as pure as a snowdrift from
Heaven.'
The witness, Dr. J. C. Holliday, gave testimony in favor of faid
defenses, a part of which is as follows:-
"On the night of Feby. 21st, I was called to see Miss Viola Parr,
She had temperature 103 degrees. I saw she had intermittent contrac-
tions of the womb. Womb about as big as an orange." I found that
her cervix was dilated, wasn't totally dilated, partially dilated."
I saw that she was going to abort no matter what I did, and with
this temperature and with this condition it would be best for her
to pass it off as soon as she could." "On Saturday morning the foetus
still had not passed away, but some more dilation had taken place."
* She didn't want people to know it. I came back Saturday afternoon
and found that the foetus had passed away." "That the afterbirth
hadn't passed there was still some portion of it in the vagina that
I removed with my fingers." that afternoon (Saturday) I made a pre-
scription for some er got to bring about contraction of the womb to
expel the remaining portion of the after birth. So that night I steril.
ized a speculum and dressing forceps and attempted to remove a
portion of the afterbirth that was hanging in the cervix and I did
remove it." "I was really afraid of my technique that night, and
thought possibly I could give it an opportunity to pass off, I mean
the afterbirth."
" I told her the next morning I would remove the
other." "She asked me if she might call it an operation." "She
says I will have to have an anaesthetic." " I suggested another
doctor or two and she declined and finally said she had rather Dr.
Summerlin would give her gas." So the time I was to meet him
there was 9 o'clock the following morning and when I reached there
he was there." # Dr. Summerlin put her to sleep with gas and
I removed the piece of the afterbirth, using a dull instrument. I
didn't use a sharp curette." # I came back Monday morning and
she was still running some temperature." "I asked for consulta.
tion again and she said she didn't want anybody else." # She went
on until Friday. I realized she was going to die, but still she
didn't consent to have anybody come out to see her." " It is prob-
lematical as to what would be the cause of septacaemia in the per-
formance of an operation of that kind." "Most likely would result
from an unsterile instrument or unsterile parts, - that is the
vagina or external genitus." "After the death of Viola Parr, I had
a conversation with Dr. Waters in reference to it, was about a
week later." "I heard him say that he understood she needed a
dilation on account of suppressed menses, as I understood, and he
did the dilation not knowing she was pregnant." "He also sadd he
thought he was doing it from a legitimate standpoint."
On Cross Examination, Dr. J. C. Holliday testified in part
as follows:- "I stated that I considered from all the evidence I
found that pregnance had extended ten weeks, -at least ten. weeks."
" I presumed, therefore, of course she had passed
off something late Saturday night, I didn't see the foetus. From
what I saw from my speculum, I saw that the neck of the womb showed
evidence of dilation. it had those little longitudinal or lateral
..

cracks, running down. What I say there, the physical facts in the
neck of the womb vere just such facts as I would ordinarily expect
to find where a dilatation had taken place in a primipara. Not
where one had taken place but where it had been done, because if
the foetus was dilating, these fissures wouldn't have been because
you would have had more of an even dilatation. I didn't make any
post mortem examination. In the examination I made I found no
evidence of violence. I found no puncture of the neck of the womb.
I found no puncture in the uterus. I found no puncture of the
amnoitic sac. I found just such things as you would find where a
woman had been dilated with some kind of instrument. The kind of
instrument she would have to be dilated with, it would depend
entirely, of course,- the instrument would have to be smaller il
the woman was a primipara. If she had been dilated before it
might not require such a small instrument,- you might use a larger
one; you might and might not. It might contract down again." "
has been the practice in medicine to dilate the womb for various
legitimate causes from time immemorial. It is a very common or-
dinary operation, the dilation of the womb. Very often younger
girls who are reaching that stage have to be dilated before there
really is any normal condition there in the way of menstruation.
Some times, owing to the condition of your patient, when on account
of cold or change in the atmosphere or shock or influenza or flu
or any cause if there is delayed and disturbed menstruation, some
times medicine will not start it back again and it requires a
dilation. It is true in the practice that this flu had had a
most wonderful effect upon women in that respect as to menstruation
and also as to childbirth and abortion. In some instances flu
has caused a cessation of menstruation and in others it has acted
entirely the reverse and caused a tremendous flow. In a great
majority of cases where there is pregnancy, if the woman has flu it
is a very dangerous thing and it would be rather to be expected
that there would be some effort at natural abortion owir
the flu. If she became in that condition while she had
flu it would be just a chance whether she came through or not."
" Very often dilation is performed in chases of nausea, I mean
pernicious nausea of pregnancy. If allowed to continue, it will
very often result in abortion. Doctors very often have to resort
to a slight dilation when nothing else will do to prevent an abor-
tion from coming on. It takes an experienced hand to do that or
else abortion will be brought on. If a man should know a woman
was pregnant and he should start out to dilate her for any reason,
he would requice a great deal of caution or else he might unwilling-
ly produce an abortion. In such a state a woman is in a more
fertile field for the operation of these pathogenic germs."
" In cases of pregnancy going along as far as the
tenth, I will say the sixteenth week, and even beyond, the foetus
during that time is still within the pelvic region and of course
therefore does not show. It is only when it appears to advanced
stages of pregnancy that there is an enlargement that shows.
First at twenty (20) weeks half way up to the navel and then some-
thing like four months it reaches the point of the navel and
six months, 3 inches above. In the ordinary case of 10 weeks unless
you make an examination especially to find out whether a woman was
pregnant there would be no objective signs to the doctor himself
in that stage of pregnancy." # The softness of the cervix and
other signs would not appear in the early stages of pregnancy. In
this stage when you are examining to find out whether a woman is
pregnant, there is no absolutely infallible ordinary rule as to
that. Doctors often make mistakes. You cannot always tell.

Dr. Williams at Johns Hopkins on obsteries is an authority."
"It is true that women very often in order to put it where they
can abort get physicians by misleading them to do certain things
which they know or somebody had told them will bring about the
desired result and induct abortion. The authorities or Tilliams
say on the other hand that some times by false statements often
made by a patient and the patient has missed one or more menstru-
ations, she may then go and complain of profused uterine hemorrhage
in the hope of misleading the physician and inducing him to intro-
duce a sound or even to curette the uterus and thereby produce
an abortion. That is well known in the medical authorities, - they
often do that." " I saw on Saturday a protrusion of this sac.
Later some placenta care out,- one or two large pieces I removed,
and the other came out in small fragments. I had given her some
er got for contraction. this brings on rather strong contraction,
the tendency would be to expel the placenta in that manner, press
it out in small shredded pieces, regardless of whether it had been
decomposed or not. That contraction is one of the first things,
that also tears apart these vessels of the placenta where they
join to the uterus and can also start a hemorrhage, - what we call
a placental hemorrhage,- That violent contraction starts it. I
didn't find her packed with gauze or anything: I didn't find
anything had been removed from the uterus. When I got down there
I found fever at 103,- that was a danger signal. Her pulse were
in accordance with her temperature,- about 90, I think. That was
somewhat a danger signal to me right then,- that was on Friday
night. It is true that sometimes it takes septicaemia some
little time to set up, longer than twenty-four or thirty six hours.
Sometimes it doesand some times it doesn't; I think I have seen
it set up in twelve hours. The former history of an early setting
up of septicaemis would be an incubation of the bacteria that
caused it. It might be some former history back of that, that
would account for the unusual phenomenon of the rapid infection.
It might be that the fertile field there would cause it to develop
quickly. If smells were present, it would take quite some little
time to bring that about. Itis possible, and there are many
caases in the books of where a woman might have had some fall or
some direct cause, either accidental or on purpose, that would
dislodge the foetus and stop its growth and the woman might carry
that in the womb for sometime, and some times for months, and it
would become somewhat incisted and more or less preserved until it
was opened up and the air struck it and then decomposition would
set up very quickly, if bacteria should get access ot it. That is
what makes decomposition. Yet as long as closed it may be carried
there for months and then suddenly opened up and decomposition
rapidly follov, followed by a condition of sepsis. If I found a
rapid septicaenia and a conditionof very quick decomposition."
there
"Withouse & Beck is a Standard Medical authority.
It is/stated that under a septic conditions it is a comparatively
harmless operation for the mother." "There are a great many
natural abortions compared to births. They are brought on by
various causes, lot of women naturally abort, they kind of get
in the habit of it. Some of the common causes are from constitu-
tional diseases, or toxemias, or from kidneys. The authorities
are right in putting it down that naturual abortions will come
on about half the time." # Abortions are brought on artificially
in numbers of instances because they are safer than births, for
fear the life of the woman is jeopardized. We consider the
patient will be in a much weaker condition in carrying the foetus
and the abortion would save mexxx. their life, of course, we
52

consider the life of mother rather than child. The death rate
from abortions in early stages of pregnancy is a little over one
per cent. One and three hundred this per cent. I know as a
matter of fact in my own practice that as a matter of general
practice, that abortions are brought about a great many times to
save the life of the mother, and lots of times they do save the
life of the mother. Barton Cook Hirst, who wrote a book in 1898,
is an authority. I agree with him when he says in this language
that the prognosis of abortion depends in a great part upon the
treatment; if every case could be treated by an aseptic curetment
at the hands of a skilled. gynaecologist the mortality of abortion
would be nil,- if you can have control of those conditions all the
way through. I do not question the following figures from that
same authority; that in a Dublin hospital out of 330 cases of abor-
tion they had only one death and that was from heart disease, and
in hospital 520 cases, 4 deaths, and only one of these the
result of abortion 120 cases in the Charity Hospital, two deaths,
87 cases in Florence Italy, 5 deaths, at Paris between 1883 and
6. 57 cases and not one death, and in the Maternity Hospital
in Paris 153 cases and l death. I would say that ordinarily an
abortion even if brought on purposely and especially in the early
stages of pregnacy would not be an operation such as you might
naturally expect that death would follow. But on the other hand
would expect that sometimes life might be saved; it is often
done for that purpose. In some instances, it is a very hard thing
to tell exactly in this day of the germ theory what sets up death
and what is the proximate and primary cause. If a man is struck
a blow on some vital organ and is put out of commission, you know
what causes his death. If a man receives a stab in a vital part
you know that the result must be death, and if a man receives a
bullet wound in a place that you know that the functions of it are
to carry on life and that function is stopped that death is the
result. But where it comes to a question of infection when there
is no wound, as to what causes infection, - what actually causes
it, usually you get your sygptons and they would give you a key to
what caused it. If you cut your hand infection is brought about
by several pathogenic germs. The majority of the cases, about 94
per cent, is the streptococcus germs, or you can have the pyogenic
staphlocci. Or you can have Colon bacillus. Or you could have four
or five other gerns, all pathogenic bacteria. Even Spanish Influenza
is also a germ disease. That is a new germ, lately discovered.
There can be in the human body the presence of these germs and some
times after pregnacy has followed or an abortion either, they can,
these gerns, that are present, set up an infection, after finding a
fertile field, that is true. You might say that would be such a
thing as autoinfection.- or in the ordinary manner when you cut your
hand or in childbirth there are a number of ways in which the streo-
tococcus germs can find their way into the system and into the walls
and set up general peritonitis. Take a case where
time at birth.. if a child is born in a room where people have had
erysipelas 07 anything that streptococcus
physician might do under those unfavorable conditions, and it was
dark and no sun light, and these germs filled the air, she might
become infected in that foul atmosphere. They found that to be true
on the Seine where a sever emptied near a hospital, which eaused
that, either from streptococcus germs or colon bacillus, and they
had to move the hospital,- that could be true. If there is in an
adjoining room a closet and the doors are not stripped over with
cloth and every precaution taken either the baciHus colon or
streptococcus germs might infect the patient. If the germ should
get in the atmosphere it is liable to go anywhere. They are
do have to take the precaution where there is an adjoining closet.
And the same thing where there is a stationary wash stand. A woman
could also be infected by her own hands. She could be infected by
her clothing that touched her there. She could be infected by the
bed clothes. If there was any touch by the patient herself she
could infect there. If she brought her finger in direct contact


Page

with her womb she could. You could set up death from streptococcus
germs, if anybody picked up here a bunch of germs and stuck them in
a place, or a bunch of typhus germs,- you could put them in a
capsule and take them or do anything to put them on the inside and
in that way infection could set up and death follow. So, nobody
can say with absolute certainty as to how infection set up in a
given case.
There are various ways in which abortion can be
brought about,- abortion could be brought about by entering a sound
in the amnoitic sac,- the liquor would be allowed to flow out and
the life of the child would be destroyed, and finally the foetus
would have to be expelled as foreign matter. I suppose if morphine
was placed on that part of the body, the child would have the
injection, and the morphine next to the uterus would kill the child
and not hurt the mother. Looks like it would because it would get
the effect from the morphine directly. I have seen authority that
one ordinafy way, if you have an electric battery, is to put one of
the poles there at the vulve and the other at the point where the
fundus of the womb would be and then set on the electric current.
I havn't seen that done. That would shock the foetus and it would
terminate dead and afterwards come out. With an ordinary abortion
where the child was only something like ten weeks, that in the
usual way would be taken out at one sitting, I think. I think
that is the customary way of doing it. But in advanced stages of
pregnancy these methods I am speaking of are only inductive or
abortion, they finally bring it about. If a young woman is an
attendant in an office and works close to an X-Ray machine it is
true the ray from the X-Ray machine, the violet ray, has a very
disintegrating and poorerful influence on flesh, if strong enough.
It is used some times on certain parts of the body to kill germs
in the body, and, therefore, if it will kill a germ lodged in the
body several inches thick,- you take spermatozoa,- it will abso-
lutely kill that. It would take a very high powerful X-Ray. I
don't know about the X-Ray machines being used to sterilize the
female and the male, I have never seen it used for that purpose.
When you are working with an X-Ray it is customary to wear a lead
apron for that purpose, for protection. You wear an apron about
the genital parts to keep from being sterilized. Then in passing
or going if she does come in contact with that, that result will
follow. I think it wahld take a prelonged exposure. Constant use
would be the same thing. I agree with Tousey, he is a standard
authority. I think from what I know about it, bhat if a woman
could become sterile by being next to an X-Ray machine it would
have very much the same effect only it would become more powerful
to absolutely stop the further development and growth of a young
foetus in the womb. I don't know much about it. I have never
owned an X-Ray. Of course, I was in the hospital where they had
them but from the authorities I have read the X-Ray will produce
sterility, and if it will produce sterility it would possibly have
some effect on the foetus. The embryo means the young child. It
may be killed in the utero, - that is the womb. A number of ex-
posures would bear an appreciable effect upon the mother, that is
possible. As a general rule a simple thing will destroy the life
of a foetus or bring about a miscarriage. Of course, if there was
direct application of a machine it would be absolutely sure. In
the first two months of pregnacy I believe the authorities put it
down that the foetus is only about two inches long. In the third
month it is about three inches long and that really in the early
part of the third month if you take an ordinary foetus you
couldn't tell whether it was the foetus of one animal or another
animal. You couldn't tell whether a human foetus or the foetus of
some animal, and the size would be as I have indicated. A child is
said to become quick by the standard authorities from four to
five months and as a general rule four and a half months is the
quickening of the child."

UDr. Waters freely and without any inducement,
without any threats on my part said - If you see Charlo Parr
tell him all in the world. I did was a simple dilation of the
womb, and I had no idea that the woman was pregnant at the time -
I thought she was above reproach.
Dr. A. c. Holliday, witness for the State, testified in part in
favor of the defenses of the defendant:-
# Miss Viola Parr said that Dr. Waters had
dilated her, and I asked her if it hurt much and she said, not
much." "I have been in Dr. Summerlin's office a few times. He
has three or four rooms, - I am not sure, he has a general reception
room where you go in. The X-Rey when I was there was down to the
left as you go in, it connects off from the reception room.
He has a dental room that connects off on the other side,- in to
the right of the reception room. When Dr. Waters came to my office
he talked very freely about it,- didn't seem to make any effort to
conceal anything. He stated there to me then and subsequently and
all the time that he did perform a dilation. I call a dilation an
operation. Sometimes a dilation will induce an abortion. He ex-
plained to me what he did on that occasion. He said he didn't know
she was pregnant,- siad he had nothing to put him on notice she was
pregnant, that she was a woman of good standing. In the general
conversation he said that he had seen the girl about on the streets,-
så id he knew her brothers and all that, and he had no reason to
suspect anything. He didn't mention Dr. Summerlin. He said he
had no reason to suspect there was anything the matter with the
girl.* "The dilation of the womb is not an unusual thing.
That is done professionally from a medical point of view often. It
is done on account of long suppressed menses. Where you have
bleeding from the inside lining of the womb you frequently dilate
and curette to relieve that condition, and a woman who wanted
to deceive her physician could tell him that she was suffering from
that excessive bleeding and get a curetage which would produce an
abortion, if he believed everything she said. I have had cases of
flu, quite a great many. Flu suppresses menses in some cases and
causes menorWhagias in others. That is excessive flow. Its
tendency in childbirth without regard to criminal abortion brings
about a tendency to naturally abort. I had several cases of that
kind." "There are a great many other things that will bring about
abortions, miscarriages and things of that kind. Kidneys if not in
condition will do it. Albuminura in the kidneys, is a consequence
of the condition you speak of,- syphillis and a great many other
things,- falls and jars of different kinds and some times you have
a dead foetus you don't know how to explain. A doctor has to go
by certain objective signs about pregnancy. Sometimes a woman by
subjective sians would know she was pregnant, and yet a doctor would
not know it by the ordinary objective signs, unless he had made
an examination for that purpose." "If a woman of reputed respecta-
bility and good character, against whom there hadn't been a breath
of suspicion, should go to an inexperienced doctor about a thing
that wouldn't cause suspicion and there were no objective signs of
pregnacy, and there wouldn't be if only ten weeks, he might very
easily be deceived as to whether or not the woman was pregnant. If
you had to determine by a diagnosis, whether there was any pregnacy,
you would have to make certain examinations before you could tell.
In other words the cessation of the monthly flow is not a positive
sign of pregnancy, that can be caused by a great many things. You
could name a hundred things possibly,- nervous anxiety could cause
suppression and does some times, - change of place, cold and climate
and those things." "If a physician didn't know of pregnancy he
would just dilate innocently without regard to there being a foetus.


Page 38.
The consequences of abortion might or might not follow, according
to the stage of pregnancy. There a number
abortion can be brought about by falls and jars, and by conditions
intentional by the woman herself, and there are a number of ways
it could be done intentionally. To puncture the sac with a sound
would be a positive way,- when you rupture the sac that would let
the liquid Blow out, and when the liquid flows out the womb con-
tracts down on it and kills the child. I only know from authori-
ties that it can be done by electricity. I have never known it,
from my own observation Authorities say it can be done and they
recommend to be very careful in the use of an X-Ray over a pregnant
uterus. That is, you can use the X-Ray on other parts of the body
but not to use it over a pregnant uterus. That is put down as one
of the ways by the authorities to produce abortion. It is also put
down by the authorities that it can produce sterility temporarily,-
thirty daus or something like that, in either of the sexes. The
foetus in the early stages of pregnancy can be destroyed some times
very easily by shock, and can be destroyed by drugs, so it will die
and stay there. It could be destroyed by morphine, and stay there.
According to authorities the foetus could be destroyed by the power-
ful ray of an X-Ray machine, - I have never seen a case of that kind.
There are authorities on the X-Ray that teach that. I have no
reason to doubt it. I know from my knowledge of an X-Ray machine
that it will break down tissue, and also cells. There are no more
delicate cells that could be found than in a foetus eight or ten
weeks old,- it is mostly a mass of cells. According to authorities
if there had been the use of an X-Ray machine, or coming in contact
with a machine of that kind, it is entirely possible and probable
in the early stages of pregnancy that would result, If for any
reason the foetus at an early age ceases to develop further, that
is, no longer growing with life, but ceases to grow, no more cells
are added, it is possible that the foetus can sometimes be carried
in the womb for a great length of time, with the sac not ruptured
any way." "If the body contracts it would keep that foetus in a
more or less preserved condition, so that sometimes, as the author.
ities say, it preserves its rosy appearance when opened. It could
be carried there for several weeks, several months. That fluid
is sterile and this foetus floats in that fluid during the whole
time of gestation. If the womb is dilated, the cervix is dilated,
and the air gets in there and oxygen and would immediately set up
a decomposition, - it should be expelled right away; if it didn't
you would have some decomposition, - you would have odors very
rapidly but possibly not until the decomposition had set in. You
would liably have very high fevers and a corresponding pulse, after
the infection. You would not have your temperature until you got
the infection. In other words, the temperature is like a ded danger
flag that sets up that shows infection in those cases. If it goes
to 100 degrees and especially to 101, all physicians think that is
very dangerous. If it runs up to 103 would stii be still more
50.
Q Now, suppose Doctor, a young woman had been carried home on
Thursday night, nearly dark, and on that next Friday night, she
was found to be in the condition that I have described, 103
fever, and an the condition where there had been a dilation
and opening up of the womb just the day before, and if there had
been in that womb a foetus that had not been living for sometime,
would it not be an indication that septina emia had set up in that
length of time because of the previous condition behind Thursday
afternoon ? A. In that instance there we have got to have the
point of infection. Insisted foetus, that is a foetus floating
in the amnoitic fluid in the sac inside of the uterus can be dead
and possibly if the placenta where it is attached to the womb is
torn some and then you get your infection which would set up very
quickly a virulent infection. But the rule is those infections


Page 39.
usually come in from three to four days. If there had been a
dilation of the womb and you had any reason to expect infection
from that particular thing, you would expect it usually that
septicaemia would set up about three or four days afterwards,
whenit sets up within twenty-four hours, it is my opinion, you
would be put on notice and suspicion that it might date behind
the dilation on Thursday. In other words, the general rule is in
all of these puerperal infections 1t follows in three or four
days. I have never seen a case where it came under three days."
#If there is a dilatation, it would sometimes set up labor,
because the placenta in those cases very often grows on after
the foetus is dead. When there is a dilatation there is a dispo-
sition set up to contract and expel, because of the dilation or
because of the placenta coming to time. When you produce that
dilatation there and then that is over with the tomb 111 con-
tract and the contraction of the womb, the clamping down of the
womb on the placenta causes that to become detached from the
uterine wall and therefore you get an expulsion of it. No, when
the uterus be mins to contract, it has the effect upon the placenta
to detach it and expel it. When they begin to contract and ex-
pel the placenta by the action of contraction of the uterus, it is
such as to separate the placenta, into threads and expel it like
that."
" The authorities, Williams and Edgar and
Hirst are standard.
Q
They put down that there are a great many natural abortions,-
some authors put it dwon about one to every realbirth and one
of the authorities says from one to five would be about the
proportion,- there are a great many abortions ? A Yeş, sir.
That come from pregnacy? Yes, sir.
Some authors put down half and half and some say about twenty-
five per cent ? A Various authors give different figures,-
I don't remember what per cent, but quite a good many; abortions
are induced expecially in the early stages of pregnancy, either
for one reason or another, they very often are done to save the
life of the mother. It is not considered an act that will in
its consequences naturally result in the death of the mother.
@
I will ask you if the percentage of death, according to
Williams, out of 391 cases is a little over one per cent
I don't remember.
?
A
It is a small fraction of a per cent ? That is my under-
standing but I don't remember the per cent. *
# A lot of those cases where those abortions are
performed, the mother is in such condition, pernicious nausea and
various causes why they should produce this abortion; the mother
might die from a toxemic condition she had before the abortion.
was ptoduced; If the necessary precautions are taken the danger is
very much less, sbsolutely perfect conditions, very much less. If
there is no infection there can't be any septica emia." "A real
septicaemia infection is the streptococus germ and that is supposed
to live on the outside and that is carried within." The great
thing in any kind of surgery or wounds is the antiseptices, to
keep it in an aseptic condition, but very often inspite of what the
physician might do, independent of him, infection sets up; A
physician might infect by his hands not being perfectly sterilized;
it is almost an impossibility to sterilize the human hands. We


Page 40.
have got that down pretty fine; we are not willing to risk it;
we use gloves. If the physician observes every precaution, there
being present streptococcus gems, the patient herself might infect
herself; with her hands she could infect herself; she could be
infected from her clothing thich has not been sterilized; she
could be infected from bed clothing not perfectly sterilized; she
could be infected from being rut in an atmosphere where there
was living millions of these streptococus germs; especially if she
was close to a stationary wash stand, it would be som or close to
a sewer closet that could be true, - any place where those germs are
numerous it is very dangerous,- an inteet 1
" It would just be a question as to how infection set up if infection
finally killed, and the most doubtful question in the world. You
can tell if a man stab a man in the heart, in a vital prgan, and
life is stopped and swear positively that he was killed by the
knife cut in the heart; if any other organ that is absolutely nec-
essary to life is destroyed by a bullet or in any other way, you
can say death occurred straight from that and you could tell what
the proximate cause was, but when there is a simple operation called
dilatation, you know that it could not be set up except by infection;
then it would be an almost impossible task for anybody to swear
with certainty as to how infection was brought about,- we would
naturally say the parts were not prepared and that the instruments
were not clean, or his hands were not clean or something, or she
was in some surroundings or something of that kind. If a woman
in that condition is put in a room where a person has had erysip-
eles,- that is practically the same kind of geam, or close to a
water closet or sink and things of that kind."
MRS. C. W. FILLINGHAM, a witness for the State, supported the
theory of the defense in a part of her testimony, to-wit:
"On Sunday morning he removed the afterbirth
and it was just in pieces and very offensive indeed." " I found
when I got there Friday night her temperature 103." " I stayed
there on Saturday night, that is when I first observed this
offensive odor." " I don't know that I ever observed an odor
like that before.
I was surprised that the odor was there,-
anybody would be."
MRS. G. D. PARR, a witness for the State, also by a part of her
testimony supported the defense of the defendant:-
"My daughter, Viola, last menstrated the first of
September - I know that because I do my own washing." "She told
me several months ago Dr. Summerlin gave her some aspirin tablets
for headache - I said you quit taking aspirin that is not good
for the heart." " I don't know what were her duties with
reference to the X-Ray machine."

Because the Court erred in
charging the jury as follows,
to-wit:
" I charge you that any person who violates the
provisions of that section of the Code that I have just read
commits an unlawful act, and I charge you further that it is
an unlawful act no matter at what stage the foetus in the mothers's
womb may be, and it is not necessary in order to constitute a
violation of that section that the child should be quick or have
arrived at that stage of development in its mothers womb where
it moved. But one who does the tings which have been prohibited
in that section of the code for the purpose of producing a mis-
carriage or abortion violates that without regard to the age of
the foetus in the mother's womb. All that is necessary to be
established is that there was a foetus in the woxxxwomb of
some age and these a cts were done for the purpose of producing
a m scarriage or abortion."
Said charge was error because the Court inadvertently
gave undue emphasis, and especially to the charge of Involuntary
vanslaughter as ainst the defendant, and gave undue emphasis
especially to Section 82 of the Penal Code, which immediately
before he had read in his charge to the jury. Section 82 of
the Penal Code was complete within itself, and easily understood
by the jury, and the above charge explaining said section only
served to emphasize it, and a mounted to an expression of opinion.
Said charge was also error for the reason that the Court
failed to char ge that it must be a live foetus . The latter part
of saia charge being as follows: "All that is necessary to
be established is that there was a foetus in the womb of some age
and these acts were done for the purpose of producing a miscarriage
or abortion.
-
59


It was especially harmful error not to charge
that the foetus must be a live foetus, in view of the fact that
it was one of the contentions and defense of the defendant
that any foetus that might have existed at the time of the
dilation of Miss Parr, the deceased, by the defendant, was a dead
foetus, and had been dead for some time before said dilation.

Briel o The Evidence
MRS. G. D. PARR, sworn for the State, testified:
Direct Examination by Nr. Dean:
My name is Mrs. G. D. Parr. I am the mother
of Viola Parr, live in Athens on Lumpkin street. I have lived
there thirty years. On or about the 20th of February of this
year, Viola Parr was working in Dr. Summerlin's office. She con-
menced some time last June, - I don't remember just the date. She
went to the office with a cousin of her's to have some dental
work done, and that same afternoon he phoned her and told her he
wanted to see her about working for him, so the next day she went
up to his office and he employed her to work. She was continuous-
ly in his employment from that time up until the 20th day of
February this year, - she come home pretty late, about dark. She was
in her usual health, I think. She had been of a nervous condition,
but had been able to continue her usual duties, - to go to and from
the office and do her work, as usual. She came home on Thursday
and she died Saturday week, and from the time she came home up until
the time of her death she was very 111. Dr. J. C. Holliday was the
physician that attended her,-then he called in A. c. Holliday) on
the Saturday morning she died that afternoon. Dr. A. C. Holliday
had been my fmaily physician. I called in Dr. Carl Holliday, as
Dr. A. C. Holliday was in Florida. Dr. J. C. Holliday atterded
her from Friday night after she came home Thursday afternoon until
her death. She made a statement to me with reference to what was
(Jury Retires)
done to her by Dr. Waters and Dr. Summerlin. At the time she made
that statement to me, she was in a dying condition. She told me?
61

she had been very 111 all day, and so on Friday afternoon before
she died Saturday says "Mama I have got something I want to tell
you,- I know I am going to die,- the doctor says I will die and
I know myself I will and I want to tell you something," I says
"Viols, what is it you want to tell me." She said "Mama, I have
done wrong," I says " Oh, Viola, you havn't done anything wrong";
says "yes, I have, Mama, I have been pregnant." I said " Viola,
who was it, who is the guilty one". She said # Dr. Summerlin,
She says "they performed an operation on me"; I says "where did they
perform it"; (she says)" In Dr. Summerlin's office. She says " I
have just suffered tortures".
She says "Mama, I believe God has
forgiven me and will you love me." I told her yes, I would love
her. But when she said in Dr. Surmerlin's office, I said "where
was Mary"; she said " she was gone." She said she believed God had
forgiven her and wanted me to pray with her and I did,- told me to
kiss her and I was so overcome I liked to have died there by myself
with her, - had something like a hard chill and she said "On, Mama,
will it kill you, will it kill you." She said "Mama, I swore not to
tell it." She said Dr. Summerlin & Dr. Waters swore her not to
tell it.
Mr. Dean :
That is the foundation.
Mr. Shackelford: Wasn't so much to the foundation
as we wanted to make certain objections to the tes-
timony which we wanted to indicate in advance. We
wanted to indicate in advance that we object to any-
thing outside of the actual res gestae at the time
of the killing and the person who was alleged to have
caused her death. The statements as to what was said
as to swearing, we don't think ought to be admissible.
In addition to that, if they were conspirators and
the conspiracy having already been performed and ended,
vie don't think if she was in life any witness could
testify as to what occurred after that. In addition
62


to that we don't think the testimony is admissible
as a dying declaration on this kind of a bill.
The Court: I will overrule the objection. I will
allow the entire narrative to go to the jury but I
will instruct the jury that the law restricts a dying
declaration in a case of homicide to two things, - the
identity of the person who committed the homicide and
the means by which the homicide was brought about.
Let the jury return. (Jury returns).
Direct by Mr. Dean (continued)
Friday afternoon before she died Saturday after-
noon she had been very ill all day and no one was in the room but
me and her in the afternoon and she says "Mama, I know I am going
to die,- the doctor told me so and I know it myself, and there is
something I want to tell you." I said "Viola, what is it"; she
said " I have done wrong and I have been pregnant", and I says
who was the guilty one"; she said # Dr. Summerlink; she says "they
performed an operation on me." I said "they,- who were they; she
said " Dr. Summerlin and Dr. Waters," I said "where did they per-
form it"; she said " in Dr. Summerlin's office."
I said "where was
Mary"; she said " she was gone."
Q What did she say caused Mary to leave ?
Mr. Shackelford: We object to the leading question.
The Court: I don't think that question is leading.
She didn't say anything only said " Mary was
gone." She said "Mama, they made me swear , - Dr. Summerlin and
Dr. Waters made me swear that I would never tell it and I wouldn't
have told it if I had known I was going to live." She died the
next day about one-thirty, I think it was; that was in the after-
noon on Friday;- that was all the statement she ever made to me.
She did tell me, - say a few more words but that was the main thing.


I was overcome and company was in there nearly all the time
after that. She said '" Mama, I believe God has forgiven me endalter
"Come and may with me" and a
She said "Mama, will you love me"; I told her "yes" she said i

single woman, and had never been married. Dr. Summerlin's office

nayed with her
ed with her the paid
Cross Examination by Mr. Shackelford:
My daughter had been working at Dr. Summerlin's
office,- she was in good health; able to discharge her duties, -
in her usual health; she had, however, been sick with flu for some
time,- she had a very light case of the flu, - I suppose it was
the flu, we didn't have a physician with her but they thought it
was, I don't know. When she came home that afternoon she seemed to
be nervous, is all I seen, like she always is when she has worked
hard all day. She was nervous, - didn't feel well,- never did, when
she came home at night because she was tired; I noticed she wasn't
feeling just like she had been. She was taken sick in the night,
Thursday night, and was in bed all day Friday, but we didn't have
a physician until Friday night. I was not up with her on Thursday
night; I knew she was sick; I asked her Thursday evening directly
after she came home. I have never been in Dr. Summerlin's office.
I see his sign up there on the outside of the building. She died
Saturday afternoon, after stating these things to me on Friday af-
ternoon; nobody was present except me. I can't remember just what
else she said, - that was the main things. I was greatly perturbed,
I was never so shocked in my 11fe; I hadn't suspicioned anything of
the kind. She was clear in the statement that Dr. Sumnerlin was
responsible for her condition, and said Dr. Waters performed an op-
eration,- didn't go into the details of it. After she told me that
she said "Mama, Dr. Summerlin and Dr. Waters made me promise not to
64


tell it.
At that time, after I had learned this, I was not in a
very quiet state of mind. She told me several months ago Dr.
Summerlin gave her some aspirin for headache and I said "you quit
taking aspirin, that is not good for the heart." She did not tell
me Friday he had given her some tablets of some kind. I don't know
what were her duties there; I think standing at the chair with the
patients. I don't know what were her duties with reference to the
X-Ray machine; she did not in this statement tell me anything in
reference to the X-Ray machine,- she was the attendant at the dental
chair; I don't know about the X-Ray. I appeared twice before the
grand jury. It is true that both times when I testified before the
grand jury that my statement was about in these words,- " she told
me she was going to die, and asked my forgiveness; that she had done
wrong and God had forgiven her." I stated, I asked her who was
responsible, and that my words were both times that she said "Dr.
Summerlin is responsible for my condition and Dr. Waters performed
an operation. That is exactly what I said before the grand jury.
Yes, sir, as well as I can remember; I can't remember word for
word. That is all I stated at that time before the grand jury.
Re-Direct by Mr. Dean:
I didn't know how she came home on Thursday
night, because I didn't see her until she came in the door. I
did not hear any automobile; I hear so many I wouldn't have
noticed if I had heard; there is a continual passing and I wouldn't .
have noticed it.
That is what she told me.

J. C. HOLLIDAY, sworn for the State, testified:
Direct by Mr. Dean:
My name is Dr. J. C. Holliday, - I live here,
Athens, Georgia, Clarke. County, and have been living here since
1909. I am a physician and surgeon. I have been a physician and
surgeon since 1909. In the year 1918, I was practicing here until
the 31st of August and I went in the Medical Reserve Corps in the
arry. I was in the array until January 30th 1919. After that time,
I returned to Athens and began practicing medicine. I left camp on
January 30th and came here on February 1st. I commenced the practice
of medicine here about the 3rd. Since that time I have been here in
Athens. I am not Mrs. G. D. Parr's regular family physician. I have
done quite a bit of work for her in the absence of Dr. A. C. Holliday;
he was her family physician. I had occasion to be called to the
home of Mrs. Parr during February; it was on the night of February
21st. I was called to see Miss Viola. I found her in very much
pain in the lower part of her abdomen and she had a hight tempera-
ture, 103; she was unwell, showing she had a flow there, - I saw
that she had intermittent contractions of the womb, and the womb
would contract and knot up; the size of it was about as big as a
large orange, I think. She, of course, would complain of very much
pain.
I asked for some hot water to cleanse my hands and I did
cleanse my hands and cleansed the parts and made an examination and
I found that her cervix was dilated, - wasn't totally dilated, - par-
tially dilated, and that she was pregnant; and so I asked her in the
absence of her mother and Mrs. Fillingham, who was also present in
the room, - I asked her if she wasn't pregnant and she said she didn't
see how she could be,- said she wasn't pregnant that she knew of ,-
in fact, she knew she wasn't.
I told her she was pregnant and she
was miscarrying, and I told her she would have to tell me all about
it or else I wouldn't continue in the case, so, she said she would
66


tell me.
In a few minutes her mother and Mrs. Fillingham came back
in the room, - I mean right at that time and that ended that con-
versation at that time. She was in so much pain I gave her a
hypodermic of morphine; the object was not to entirely ease her
but to make the pain so she could bear it.
I saw that she was going
to abort no matter what I did and with this temperature and with this
condition it would be best for her to pass it off as soon as she
could. I told her, however, the hypodermic possibly wouldn't en-
tirely ease her but under the condition it was best not to get her
entirely easy at this time. So, I came back the following morning,
which was Saturday morning, and the foetus still hadn't passed away
but some more dilatation had taken place,- that is the opening of
the womb had grown large. So, in the absence of her mother, I told
her that she would have to bear down to her pain and get rid of the
foetus as soon as she could,- that was the only way she could ever
get rid of it and something to ease her would be against her. So,
she told me that she would bear down to the pains and say as little
as she possible could, she didn't want people to know it. I came
back Saturday afternoon and found that the foetus had passed away,
that the afterbirth hadn't passed,- there was still some portion of
it in the vagina that I removed with my fingers.
I don't think any
of the afterbirth had passed then. So, Saturday night I was called
back again. That afternoon I made a prescription for some ergot to
bring about contraction of the womb to expel the remaining portion
of the afterbirth. So, that night she got in extreme pain again
and called me back and I sterilized a speculum and dressing forcep
and attempted to remove a portion of the afterbirth that was hanging
in the cervix and I did remove it, but I could tell it hadn't all
passed away by the way this pulled in two. So, I told her that next
morning I would remove the other. I was really afraid of my technique
that night and thought possibly I would give it an opportunity to
pass of?,- I mean, the afterbirth. So, she asked me if she might
call it an operation and I said "well, it is in reality a small
67


operation." She says " I will have to have an anaesthetic" and
I told her I didn't think she would need an anaesthetic, I wasn't
going to hurt her much". She said she had had so much pain she
didn't feel like she could stand any more and she wanted me to
have somebody to put her to sleep. So, I suggested another doctor
or two and she declined and finally she said had rather Dr. Summerlin
would give her gas, - that she had taken gas before and she didn't
mind it, it didn't make her sick. When her mother came back in the
room she told her mother the conversation we had and she was going
to let Dr. Summerlin come out and give the gas the following morn-
ing. So, the time I was to meet him there was nine o'clock the
following morning and when I reached there he was there, - that is,
his car was there; he was in the house. I had previously steril.
ized my instruments before I left the office and wrapped them in a
sterile towel, but I went ahead and sterilized them again after I
go there, and. I fixed up a cyanide solution to use in a fountain
syringe and cleansed her with an antiseptic solution and Dr. Summerlin
put her to sleep with gas and I removed the piece of the afterbirth,
using a dull instrument. I didn't use a sharp curette. I didn't
come back Sunday afternoon but I did come back Monday morning and she
was still running some temperature. Then she began to suffer head-
a che,- pain in her head, and continued to grow worse all the while,
and I was at that time giving her ergot to cause contraction of the
womb, so she wouldn't absorb the toxemia; I was also irrigating
the womb with a weak cyanide solution. By that time she showed direct
signs of septicaemia,- that is, it began to get a real good hold.
So Wednesday morning she had a severe chill and they called me out and
I went out and I continued my treatment as I was doing and I asked
for consultation and she said she didn't want anybody else, and so I
told her mother I didn't care for all the responsibility in that case
and I would like for her to get another physician. She told me she
would see about it and let me know when I came back. When I came
; 68


back she told me she didn't want another physician, that they
knew I was doing all I could and they were perfectly satisfied.
She went on until Friday. I realized she was going to die, but
still she didn't consent to have anybody come out to see her. So,
Friday night when I was out I asked them about consultation and
they decided to have somebody the following morning, which was
Saturday morning. Saturday morning they called in Dr. A. C. Holliday
and I was to meet him there but I was detained and he reached the
place before I did and stayed some little bit and left. When I got
there we had him to come back and, of course, we decided she was
dying and although still conscious; I told her I wanted her to tell
Dr. Holliday, just who was responsible for it and who produced the
abortion. She said "it was just as I have told you." I said "what
did you tell mek; she said " I told you that Dr. Summerlin was re-
sponsible for my condition and that Dr. Waters produced the abor-
tion." I says "where did he do it"; she says " in Dr. Summerlin's
office." So, that concluded our conversation, that is, concluded
the part I know is the dying statement. She went on and died about
one or one-thirty that afternoon.
As well as I remember, she died
about one-thirty,- might have been two, but I think one or one-thirty,
along about that time. The direct cause of her death was the result
of the abortion. Septicaemia was produced by the abortion that
caused her death. The common term for septicaemia is blood poison-
ing. The germs that mulitply in the womb, she absorbs that, and
also absorbs the toxin that causes them. It is problematical as
to what would be the cause of septicaemia in the performance of an
operation of that kind for the purpose of producing an abortion and
miscarriage, - most likely would result from an unsterile instrument
or unsterile part,- that is the vagina or external genitus. I ex-
amined her at first and made a careful examina tion, - I found with
reference to the miscarriage, as to her condition at that time, that
the cervix showed signs of having been dilated. There were small
69
