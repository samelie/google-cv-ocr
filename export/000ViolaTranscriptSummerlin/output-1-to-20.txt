a sentence of three years in the penitentiary under said
verdict of guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the
commission of an unlawful act; and,


#
BE IT FURTHER REMEMBERED that counsel for
the said M. T. Summerlin filed a motion for new trial
before the adjournment of court and within the time
allowed by law for the presentation of said motion for
new trial after the rendition of said verdict; and,
BE IT FURTHER REMEMBERED that said original
motion for new trial was approved by the court and
assigned for a hearing in vacation on the 21st day of
June, 1919. The thàæge of the court to the jüry in the
trial of said case against the defendant, M. T. Summerlin
was duly approved after the same had been written out
by the court reporter and ordered filed, and said charge
is now of file in the clerk's office of the Superior
Court of Clarke County, Georgia; and after having filed
a motion for new trial counsel for the defendant made
application to his Honor Andrew J. Cobb, the presiding
judge in said case, to grant the defendant bail, and said
application having been refused, the defendant is now
confined in the common jail of said county; the defendant
was then and there able and ready and willing to give
bond in any sum that the court might see fit to fix and
allow; and,
BE IT FURTHER REMEMBERED that the order fixing
the hearing of said motion for new trial in vacation
having been XELUXE fully complied with and the
Solicitor-General and the State's counsel having been
duly served with a copy of the amended motion and the
brief of evidence as required by said order fixing the
hearing of said motion for new trial in vacation; and
said mo tion for new trial came on for a hearing on said

evidence having been agreed upon by counsel for the
State and for the defendant, the court passed an order
approving said brief of evidence as being a true and
correct brief of the evidence submitted to the jury upon
the trial of said case, and that said amended motion and
said brief of evidence was dudy filed within the time
allowed by law and in compliance with said order on Pin
in the clerk's office of the Superior Court of Clarke
County, Georgia; and,
BE IT FURTHER REMEMBERED that after the pre-
sentation of said original motion and said amended
motion his Ho nor Andrew J. Cobb, judge of said court
then and there pre sėding, then and there overruled
said motion for new trial and refused defendant a new
trial,- said order being as follows:
"This motion and amendment thereto
came on to be heard this day in vacation
under an order granted in term.
Treating the motion and amendment
thereto as constituting a valid motion for
new trial, it is ordered that the motion be
overruled and a new trial refused.
This order refusing a new trial is
based upon two reasons:
1st. The motion and amendment are
nullities as they seek to set aside only a
portion of a single verdict and this cannot
be done by motion for new trial - such a
motion sets aside the entire verdict - a
verdict is not separable in a case like the
present.
2nd. Each and every ground of the motion
and amendment is without merit.
This June 21, 1919.
Andrew J. Cobb
Judge s.c.w.."
BE IT FURTHER REMEMB ERED that said motion
for new trial and the amendment to said motion for new
trial were by the court overruled on each and every
ground therein stated. To this judgment of the court
overruling said motion for new trial and the amendment
thereto and each and every ground therein set forth,
the defendant excepted and here and now excepts and


#5.
assigns error thereon and says the court erred in
overruling said motion for new trial and on each and
all of the grounds therein stated, in said original
motion for new trial and the amendment thereto.
The defendant here and now assigns error
upon the court's overruling each and every ground in
said original motion for new trial and the amendment
thereto as therein set out. The defendant, M. T.
Summerlin in the court below, now the plaintiff in
error, specifies the following portions of the record
in said case as material to a clear understanding of
the errors assigned in this Bill of Exceptions, to-wit:
1st. The original presentment against
defendant No.1738;
2nd. The plea of not guilty of said defendant
to said presentment;
3rd. The three verdicts, as to M. T. Summerlin,
of the jury in said case bearing date of May 16, 1919;
4th. The charge of the court in said case
and the order approving same;

filed by defendant in said case on May 22, 1919,
and the order of time court fixing a hearing thereon
and the acknowledgment of service;

THE STATE
VS
Clarke Superior Court.
April Adjourned Term 1919.
Presentment for Murder etc., and
Verdict of Guilty of Involuntary
Mansalughter in the Commission of an
Unlawful Act.
M. T. SUMMERLIN
CHARGE OF THE COURT,
Gentlemen of the Jury:-
The Grand Jury of this County have preferred a presentan
ment against W. G. Waters and M. T. Summerlin. The presentment
contains what we call in law three counts. In the first count
the defendants are charged with the offense of murder. In the
second count the defendants are charged with the offense of
involuntary mansalughter in the commission of an unlawful act.
In the third count the defendants are charged with the offense
of assault with intent to murder.
M. T. Summerlin is alone en trial, and to this presenta
ment and each of its counts he has interposed his plea of not
guilty, which means that he denies that he is guilty of all and
each of the offenses charged in the separate counts of the indict
ment. This plea of not guilty to the several counts of the
indictment makes the issues which you are to determine.
The law presumes every person to be innocent of crime
until his guilt has been established in the manner prescribed
by law, and this presumption remains with a man throughout his
trial until it is overcome by evidence which satisfies the mind
and the conscience of the jury of the guilt of the accused of the
crime charged in the indietment, or, if there are one or more
counts in the indictment, of one or more of the counts of the
crimes charged in the several counts.
The first count of the indictment reads that the said
W. G. Waters and M. T. Summerlin on the 20th day of February in
the year 1919, in the county and state aforesaid, did then and
there unlawfully and with force and arms, in and upon one Viola
Parr, in the peace of God and said State, unlawfully, feloniously
and willfully, and of their malice aforethought, did kill and
murder, by then and there using and employing a certain instru-
ment and instruments to the grand jurors unknown by inflicting


in and on the person of said Viela Parr a mortal wound, of which
said mortal wound the said Viola Parr died; and the grand jurers
upon their oaths aferesaid do say that the said W.G.Waters and
M. T. Summerlin the said Viola Parr in the manner and form
aforesaid unlawfully, feloniously and willfully and of their
malice aforethought did kill and murder, contrary to the laws of
said state, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.
Homicide is the killing of a human being and is of three
kinds, - murder, manslaughter and justifiable homicide.
Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, in the
peace of the State, by a person of sound memory and discretion,
with malice aforethought, either express or implied. The law
presumes every person to be of sound mind until the contrary
appears.
Express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully
to take away the life of a fellow creature, which is manifested
by external circumstances capable of proof,
Malice may exist and there may be ne evidence of express
malice, but it may be implied. Malice shall be implied, says the
law, where no considerable provocation appears and where all the
cireumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant
hearta
If a killing shall happen in the commission of an unlaw-
ful act which, in its consequences, naturally tends to destroy
the life of a human being, the offense shall be deemed and
adjudged to be murder,
The second count of this indictment is as follows: And
the grand jurers aforesaid, in the name and behalf of the cit.
izens of Georgia, do further charge and accuse the said W.G.
Waters and M.T. Summerlin with the offense of involuntary man-
slaughter in the commission of an unlawful act, for that the
said W.G. Waters and M.T. Summerlin, in the county and state
aforesaid, on the 20th day of February, in the year of our Lord,
1919, with force and arms and without any intention to do so, but
in the commission of an unlawful act, did unlawfully, feloniously
and willfully kill Viola Parr, the said Viola Parr being at the
