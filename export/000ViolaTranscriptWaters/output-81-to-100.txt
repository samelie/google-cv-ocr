lacerations or fissures, we might call them, and they were
infected. The lacerations, I have described, showed white mattery
looking.
The afterbirth passed in fragments and showed either
it had been torn by an instrument or had been the direct result
of bacteira that caused it to decompose. Part of it passed on
Saturday night and I removed the remaining portion the next morning.
Sunday morning. I removed the umbilical cord Saturday night.
That was before I performed the operation when Dr. Summerlin was
there. Sunday morning I performed the operation when Dr. Summerlin
was present. The foetus passed some time between Saturday morning
and Saturday afternoon about five or six o'clock. As the physician
for Mrs.Parr or Miss Parr, I did not advise that this operation
or abortion was necessary for the purpose of saving her life. It was
not necessary for the purpose of saving her life, if she at that
time was a well young woman and performed her usual duties with
reference to her daily vocation. I did not know or did not advise
the performance of this operation for the purpose of producing
this miscarriage. I have never seen Dr. Water's diploma, but I
understand he is an osteopath. Since she was a primipara, that is
a woman with her first pregnacy, and no dilatation never taken
place, you would have to use an instrument, a pointed instrument,
to have produced this miscarriage or abortion; one that was large
couldn't be introduced into the cervix. Any character of instrument
though, that did dilatation, would produce those fissures. After
the death of Viola Parr, I had a conversation with Dr. Waters with
reference to it. One conversation was in Dr. A. C. Holliday's
office. I had another conversation with him in his own office,-
Dr. Water's office. The conversation in Dr. A. C. Holliday's
office with Dr. Waters, I think, was Saturday afternoon; I am not
positive, - it was pretty shortly after the death of Miss Parr, I
don't know; it might have been Monday afternoon; I don't remember
just the day of the conversation,- shortly after the death. The
70


-11-
conversation I had with him, in his office, was about a week later.
In the conversation I had with him in Dr. A. C. Holliday's office,
I didn't say very much to him myself, but I heard him say that he
understood that she needed a dilatation on account of having
suppressed menses, as I understood, and he did the dilatation not
knowing she was pregnant. That was in Dr. A. C. Holliday's office.
He said the operation was performed in Dr. Summerlin's office. He
said he was called. The conversation I had with Dr. Waters in his
own office, was identically the same thing. He admitted to me there
that he did a dilatation. He also said he thought he was doing it
from a legitimate standpoint.
Cross by Mr. Shackelford:
Speaking about osteopathy,- there are two schools
of medicine, one is the school I belong to and one is the school
Dr. Waters belongs to. I don't really know whether the osteopaths
have a right under the Code of performing childbirth, delivering
childbirth and also surgery and osteopathy, or not.
The Court: You need not examine him on the
law. If he knows what the practice of an
osteopath is, he can state that.
I don't know just what the osteopath's range is.
On this particular time that I was called out there, it was
Friday night some what late, about eleven o'clock. I became satis-
fied from my examination then that there was a pregnacy; I stated
that I considered from all the evidence I found that pregnacy had
extended ten weeks,- at least ten weeks. I did nothing in the way
of an operation that night. She denied that there was anything
the matter with her; said she didn't see how she could be. There


-12-
wasn't anybody in the room when I talked to her then, - just Viola
and myself. She denied being pregnant,- said she didn't see how
she could be. At that time I noticed there was a distension or
dilatation of the cervix of the womb to some extent, - then I came
back again on Saturday morning, and I made another examination; I
only examined it with my hands,- didn't use a speculum.
I made a
digital examination on Friday night, and on Saturday I made another
digital examination but did not use the speculum then, - I did use
the speculum late Saturday night. Fron the time I had come and gone
there had been something emptied from the uterus. It did not bear
the same shape.
I presumed, therefore, of course, she had passed
off something late Saturday night. I made an examination with my
speculum, after this emptying of the womb. I didn't see the foetus.
From what I saw from my speculum, I saw that the neck of the womb
shoved evidence of dilatation; it had those little longitudinal or
lateral cracks, running down. What I saw there, the physical facts
in the neck of the womb were just such facts as I would ordinarily
expect to find where a dilatation had taken place in a primipara.
Not where one had taken place but where it had been done, because if
the foetus was dilating, these fissures wouldn't have been because
you would have had more of an even dilatation.
I didn't make any
post mortem examination. In the examination I made. I found no
evidence of violence. I found no puncture of the neck of the womb.
I found no puncture in the uterus. I found no puncture of the
amnoitic sac. I found just such things as you would find where a
woman had been dilated with some kind of instrument. The kind of
instrument she would have to be dilated with, - it would depend en-
tirely, of course, - the instrument would have to be smaller if the
woman was a primipara. If she had been dilated before it might not
require such a small instrument, - you might use a larger one; you
might and might not. It might contract down again. A Uterine
dilator is just a little steel instrument that is very much like
- 72


-13-
you would find in a dry goods store in a glove stretcher.
It is
made on the same principle, - two parts come together and you
push the handle here and they spread that way and are graded with
notches so you can dilate half an inch or a quarter of an inch so
you are sure you won't get too much. Some of them havn't that
apparatus on the handle; some depend on the sense of touch and not
the gradation nothces, and it is just about as effective. I think
the uterine dilator has been used from almost time immemorial in
medicine, - been used way back in some form or another. It has been
the practice in medicine to dilate the womb for various, legitimate,
causes, from time immemorial. Itis a very common ordinary operation,
the dilatation of the womb. Very often younger girls who are reach-
ing that state have to be dilated before there really is any normal
condition there in the way of menstruation. Some time, owing to the
condition of your patient, when on account of cold or change in
atmosphere or shock or influenza or flu or any cause, if there is
delayed and disturbed menstruation, some times medicine will not start
it back again and it requires a dilation.
I don't know as I have ever
done it for suppressed menstruation but I have heard of it being done
for suppressed menstruation. If the opening is occluded you might
have to do it, or if the womb is bent or pressed, -autoflection or
retroflection. It is true in the practice of medicine here as well as
in New Yorkthat pamplets have been issued that show that this flu
had a most wonderful effect upon women in that reppect as to menstry-
and also as to Child birth and aboution. Fla has caused He ceran hon meurtruaton,
ation, and in some instances it has acted entirely the reverse and
caused a tremendous flow.
In a great majority of cases where there is
impregnation, pregnacy, if the woman has the flu, it is a very dan-
gerous thing and it would be rather to be expected that there would
be some effort at natural abortion, owing to the severity of the
flu.
Of course, if she became in that condition when she had flu
it would be just a chance whether she came through without natural
abortion or not; it has a great influence upon the blood. Physicians
haven't yet determined all the influences it has but it is a very
23


-14-
powerful one in every direction. Very often dilation is performed
in cases of nausea,- I mean pernicious nausea. Sometimes you can
use all the medicine you want to and the pernicious nausea con-
tinues. I mean pernicious nausea of pregnacy. If allowed to con-
tinue it will finally result in abortion, very often. Doctors
very often have to resort to a slight dilation when nothing else
will do to prevent an abortion from coming on. It takes an experi-
enced hand to do that, or else the abortion will be brought on.
If a man shouba know a woman was pregnant and he should start out
to dilate her for any reason, he would require a great deal o*
caution, or else he might unwittingly produce an abortion. And he
would also in such circumstances have to take great precaution as
to infection, as to hands and as to instruments and the parts. In
such a state a woman is in a more fertile field for the operation
of these pathogenic germs. When a man does not know that there is
any pregnacy, he would at least use the greatest precaution any
way, because some times with the best precaution we get an infec-
tion. In cases of pregnacy going, along as far as the tenth, I will
say the sixteenth week, and even beyond, the foetus, however, was
in that time still within the pelvic region. And, of course, there-
fore, doesn't show,- it is only when it appears to advanced stages
of pregnacy that there is an enlargement that shows first at twenty
weeks half way to the navel and then something like four months when
it reached the point of the navel and six months three inches above, -
in the ordinary case of ten weeks, unless you make an examination
especially to find out whether a woman was pregnant, there would
be no objective signs to the doctor himself in that stage of preg-
nacy. You would find a softening of the cervix, velvety feel. You
would find a blueness of the membrane. The softness of the cervix
comes about at the end of the third month. Naturally the cervix is
of the same hardness as the cartilage in the bones and after the end
of the third month it is of the softness of lips,- so that sign


-15-
wouldn't appear in the early stages of pregnacy.
In the early
stages of pregnacy when you are examining to find out whether a
woman is pregnant, there is no absolutely infallible ordinary rule
as to that. Doctors often make mistakes, - you can't always
tell,- Williams at John Hopkins, - Dr. Williams is a standard
authority. It is true that women very often in order to put it
where they can abort get physicians by misleading them to do
certain things which they know or somebody had told them will
bring about the desired result and induct abortion. The author-
ities or Williams say on the other hand that some times by false
statements often made by a patient and the patient has missed one
or more menstruations, she may then go and complain of profused
uterine hemorrhage in the hope of misleading the physician and
inducing him to introduce a sound or even to curette the uterus and
thereby produce an abortion. That is well known in the medical
authorities, - they often do that. If a woman with the same kind
of story came to me and said say I have missed my menses, or that
she had missed them altogether on account of flu or some cause
that is perfectly natural I would not go ahead and do what was
necessary under such cases, dilatation. I would wait until I got
some systemic infection,- until she suffered severe headaches or I
had evidence enough to know it was necessary to do this operation.
If a woman said she had been dilated before for suppressed menstru-
ation and it had relieved her, and I believed what she said I
would go ahead. If she had other signs of pregnacy; I would give
it a few thoughts before I did it. If there is nausea, then it is
at least six weeks. That is only a subjective sign.
I saw on
Saturday a protrusion of this sac. Later some placenta came out, -
one or two large pieces I removed, and the other came out in small
fragments. I had given her some ergot for contraction,- this brings
on rather strong contraction, the tendency would be to expel the
placenta in that manner, press it out in small shredded pieces,


-16-
regardless of whether it had been decomposed or not. That contrac-
tion is one of the first things, that also tears apart these
vessels of the placenta where they join to the uterus and can also
start a hemorrhage, - what we call a placental hemorrhage. That vio-
lent contraction starts it. I didn't find her packed with gauze
or anything; I didn't find anything had been removed from the uter-
us. When I got down there I found fever at 103,- that was a danger
signal. Her pulse were in accordance with her temperature, - about
90, I think. That was some what a danger signal to me right then,-
that was on Friday night. It is true that sometimes it takes
septicaemia some little time to set up, longer than twenty-four or 36
hours. Some times it does and some times it doesn't; I think I
have seen it set up in twelve hours. The former history of an early
setting up of septica enia would be an incubation of the bacteria
that caused it. It might be some former history back of that, that
would account for the unusual phenomenon of the rapid infection.
It might be that the fertile field there would cause it to develop
quickly. If smells were present, it would take quite some little
time to bring that about. It is possible, and there are many
cases in the books of where a woman might have had some fall or
some direct couse, either accidental or on purpose, that would
dislodge the foetus and stop its growth and the woman might carry
that in the womb for some time, and some times for months,- and it
would become somewhat insisted and more or less preserved until it
was opened up and the air struck it and then decomposition would
set up very quickly, if bacteria should get access to it. That is
what makes decomposition. Yet as long as closed it may be carried
there for months and then suddenly opened up and decomposition
rapidly follow, followed by a condition of sepsis. If I found a
rapid septicaemia and a condition of very quick decomposition, I
would not necessarily look back to to some cause behind it further
than only thirty-six hours before. It is probable that you could.


As a rule infection takes place any where from twelve hours to
four or five days after the infection is carried there. As to
how death sets up, and as to how a wound can become infected.
Withause & Beck is a standard authority. It is owing to her
physical condition,- that would have a bearing on it, as to
whether or not the induction of abortion is more likely to produce
septicaemia than any other operation & equal gravity. It is also
stated that under aceptic conditions it is a comparatively harm-
less operation for the mother. You get a variation of the pro-
portion of natural abortions and births;
I don't remember what the
figures are. There are a great many natural abortions compared
to births. They are brought on by various sources,- lots of women
naturally abort,- they kind of get in the habit of it. Some of
the most common ways is from any constitutional diseases or toxemia
from the kidneys. The authorities are right in putting it down
that natural abortions will come on about half the time. Abortions
are brought on artificially in numbers of instances because they
births
are safer than, a, for fear the life of the woman is jeopardized.
Ve consider the patient will be in a much weaker condition in
carrying the foetus and the abortion would save their life,- of
course, we consider the life of mother rather than child. The
death rate from abortions in early stages of pregnacy is a little
and
over one per cent. One to three hundred per cent. I know as a
matter of fact in my own practice that as a matter of general
practice, that abortions are brought about a great many times to
and lots of Times they do save the life in the mother,
save the life of the mother.' Barton Cook Hirst, who wrote a
book in 1898, is an authority. I agree with him when he says in
ter
this language that the prognosis of abortion depends in a great part
upon the treatment; if every case could be treated by an aceptic
curetment at the hands of a skilled gynaecologist the mortality of
abortion would be nil,- if you can have control of those conditions
all the way through. I do not question the following figures from
that same authority; titt in a Dublin hospital out of 330 cases


-18-
of abortion they had only one death and that was from heart
disease, and in a Berlin hospital 520 cases, 4 deaths, and only
one of these the result of abortion, 120 cases in the Charity
Hospital, two deaths, 87 cases in Florence, Italy, 5 deaths, at
Paris between 1883 and 1886, 57 cases and not one death, and in
the Maternity Hospital in Paris 153 cases and 1 death. I would
say that ordinarily an abortion even if brought on purposely and
especially in the early stages of pregnacy would not be an oper-
ation such as you might naturally expect that death would follow.
But on the other hand I would expect that sometimes life might
be saved; it is often done for that purpose. In some instances,
it is very hard thing to tell exactly in this day of the germ
theory what sets up death and what is the proximate and primary
cause. If a man is struck a blow on some vital organ and is put
out of commission, you know what causes his death.
If a man
receives a stab in a vital part you know that the result must be
death, and if a man receives a bullet wound in a place that you
know that the functions of it are to carry on 11fe and that
function is stopped that death is the result. But where it comes to
a question of infection when there is no wound, as to what causes
infection, - what actually causes it, usually you get your symptons
and they would give you a key to what caused it. If you cut your
hand infection is brought about by several pathogenic germs. The
majority of the cases, about 94 per cent, is the streptococcus
germs, or you can have the pyogenic sta phlocci. Or you can have
Colon bacillus. Or you could have four or five other germs, all
pathogenic bacteria. Iven Spanish Influenza is also a germ disease.
That is a new germ, lately discovered. There can be in the human
body the presence of these germs and some times after pregnacy has
followed or an abortion either, they can, the germs, that are
present, set up an infection, after finding a fertile field, that
is true. You might say that would be such a thing as autoinfec.
tion, - or in the ordinary manner when you cut your hand or in
28


childbirth there are a number of ways in which the streptococcus
germs can find their way into the system and into the walls and
set up general peritonitis. Take a case where there is full
clied
time at birth, - if a is born in a room where people have
had erysipelas or anything, that streptococcus germ, in spite of
all the physicians might do under those unfavorable conditions,
and it was dark and no sun light, and these germs filled the air,
she might become infected in that foul atmosphere. They found that
to be true on the Seine where a sewer emptied near a hospital,
which caused that, either from streptococcus germs or colon bacil-
lus, and they had to move the hospital,- that could be true. If
there is in an adjoining room a closet and the doors are not strip-
ped over with cloth and every precaution taken either the bacillus
colon or streptococcus germs might infect the patient. If the
germ should get in the atmosphere it is liable to go any where.
They do have to take the precaution where there is an adjoining
closet. And the same thing where there is a stationary wash
stand. A woman could also be infected by her own hands. , She could
Sile could he u leeved by the bed clothes.
be infected by her clothing that touahed her there. If there was
any touch by the patient herself she could infect there. If she
brought her finger in direct contact with her womb she could. You
could set up death from streptococcus germs, if anybody picked up
here a bunch of germs and stuck them in a place, or a bunch of
typhus germs, - you could put them in a capsule and take them or
do anything to put them on the inside and in that way infection
could set up and death follow. So, nobody can say with absolute
certainty as to how' infection set up in a given case. There are
various ways in which abortion can be brought about, - abortion
could be brought about by entering a sound in the amniotic sac,-
the liquor would be allowed to flow out and the life of the child
would be destroyed, and finally the foetus would have to be ex-
pelled as foreign matter. I suppose if morphine was placed on that
79


- 20-
part of the body, the child would have the injection, and the
morphine next to the uterus would kill the child and not hurt the
mother. Looks like it would because it would get the effect
from the morphine directly. I have seen authority that one ordi.
nary way, if you have an electric battery, is to put one of the
poles there at the vulva and the other at the point where the
fundus of the womb would be and then set on the eledtric current.
I havn't seen that done. That would shock the foetus and it would
terminate dead and afterwards come out. With an ordinary abortion
where the child was only something like ten weeks, that in the
usual way would be taken out at one sitting, I think. I think
that is the customary way of doint it. But in advanced stages of
pregnacy these methods I am speaking of are only inductive or abor-
tion, - they finally bring it about. If a young woman is an at-
tendant in an office and works close to an X-Ray machine it is
true the ray from the X-Ray machine, the violet ray, has a very
disintegrating and powerful influence on flesh, if strong enough.
It is used some times on certain parts of the body to kill germs
in the body, and, therefore, if it will kill a germ lodged in the
body several inches thick,- you take spermatozoca,- it will
absolutely kill that. It would take a very high powerful X-Ray.
I don't know about the X-Ray machines being used to sterilize the
female and the male, I have never seen it used for that purpose.
When you' are working with an X-Ray it is customary to wear a lead
apron for that purpose, for protection. You wear an apron above
the genital parts to keep from being sterilized. Then in passing
or going if she does come in contact with that, that result will
follow. I think it would take a prolonged exposure. Constant use
would be the same thing. I agree Tousey is a standard authority.
I think from what I know about it, that if a woman could become
sterile by being next to an X-Ray machine it would have very much
the same effect only it would become more powerful to absolutely
80


-21-
stop the further development and growth of a young foetus in the
womb. I don't know much about it. I have never owned an X-Ray.
Of course, I was in the hospital where they had them but from the
authorities I have read the X-Ray will produce sterility, and if
it will produce sterility it would possibly have some effect on
the foetus. The embryo means the young child. It may be killed
in the utero, - that is the womb. A number of exposures would
bear an appreciable effect upon the mother, that is possible.
As a general rule a simple thing will destroy the life of a foetus
or bring about a miscarriage. Of course, if there was direct
application of a machine it would be absolutely sure. In the first
two months of pregnacy I believe the authorities put it down that
the foetus is only about two inches long. In the third month it is
about three inches long and that really in the early part of the
third month if you take an ordinary foetus you couldn't tell
whether it was the foetus of one animal or another animal. You
couldn't tell whether a huren foetus or the foetus of some animal,
and the size would be as I have indicated. A child is said to
standard
become quick by the authorities from four to five months and as a
general rule four and a half months is the quickening of a child.
They may become quick earlier than that,- as early as three months.
That would be an exceptional case. The usual and ordinary time is
between the fourth and fifth month. By quickening you mean the
child then has begun to have separate movements, so to speak, from
the mother. Its breathing functions have been set up, the foetal
heart at four months has begun to beat. Its blood system has de-
veloped. The respiratory system has developed. At four and a half
months it becomes a separate individual being, so to speak. It is
termed quick when it begins to move. Dr. Waters freely and without
any inducement, without any threats upon my part, promises or hope
of reward, told me exactly what he told me. He said " if you see
Charley Parr, tell him." All in the world he did was a simple
dilation of the womb and he had no idea that the woman was pregnant
81


22-
at the time; thought was she was above reproach.
Re-Direct by Mr. Dean:
The umbilical cord was about the size of a lead
pencil and about six or eight inches long. I hardly think influ-
enza would cause an umbilical cord to be formed there. Influenza
would not cause pregnacy. I said the umbilical cord was about
six or eight inches long, and about the size of a lead pencil.
If
a woman advanced in the stages of pregnacy to where the umbilical
cord was that length and that size and a physician was called upon
to dilate the womb for menstruation, if he made an examination, he
could ascertain the fact that the woman was pregnant,- the cause of
the afterbirth in this case passing in the manner that I said it
passed, in pieces, torn and bleeding and all, was either due to the
result directly of bacteria or to the fact that it was possibly torn
with an instrument, - either of which could have been the result.
Q Doctor, when an attempt is made to produce a miscarriage and an
abortion and it is wanted to be made successful, isn't it true
they usually go in there and churn it up in such a way as to tear
up the afterbirth ? A If they want to produce it to make a
success
Mr. Shackelford: We object to that. As to what was
done in this particular case, - what he found to be
done.
The Court: He can ask his opinion as an expert how
an abortion might be produced.
A (by witness) If he wants to be sure there will be an abortion
and not possibly have much regard for her safety it would be all
right to do it in that manner.


-23-
QIf it is done in that manner and done for the purpose of
producing an abortion, isn't it a most dangerous operation and
liable to result in the death of the woman ? A owing to whether
or, not, how soon it passes off and whether bacteria was present
or not, - also the condition of the patient.
It is almost inpossible to get an ideal con-
dition in which to do a thing of that kind, because you have a
fertile field. If there isn't ideal conditions, as to whether or
not, it is always attended with danger, it is owing to the resis-
tance of the patient, - owing to the type of bacteria that is intro.
duced and owing to how varient they are, whether varient type or
benign type.
Re-Cross by Mr. Shackelford.
It depends a great deal about discovering
pregnacy as to whether a man is making the examination with that
end in view. Also upon the stage of pregnacy. There are no posi-
obratene
tive signs before the third month. There might be subjective
signs to the patient but not objective to the physician.
Authorities like Himst state that it was very early established
the umbi lical cord,
that it, may be 70 inches long and some times as many as 380
torsions, twists, and in very many instances it wraps around the
body of the child and some times around the neck and causes
strangulation. The authorities put down some times it is very
short; just a little bit of a thing, and in some cases, according
to Hirst, the umbilical cord is entirely absent and a child feeds
from the placenta alone.

A. C. HOLLIDAY, sworn for the State, testified:
Direct by Mr. Dean:
reen
My name is A. C. Holliday, I live in Athens,
Georgia. I have lived here twenty-six years in all. I am engaged
in practicing medicine. I have been practicing medicine thirty-
five years. I know Mrs.,G. D. Parr, - I have known her some fifteen
or twenty years. I have, her family physician for some period of
time. I knew Miss Viola Parr, - have known her ever since she was
a small girl,- some fifteen years, I suppose. I think it was
Saturday, March the 1st, if 'I am not mistaken about the date, that
I was called to the home of Mrs G. D. Parr. I was called to see
Miss Viola Parr,- she was in a dying condition, - really dying. I
was there about twenty minutes on my first visit. I gave her a
teatrogacone
hypodermie of strychninen OI' think about an hour or an hour and
fifteen minutes I was called back again. Dr. J. C. Holliday was
present at that time. We gave her another hypodermic of strych-
auduino Glyeluul,
nine, - that was about ten o'clock and I understood that she died
some where around one o'clock. I examined her pulse and in-
I make
spected her. No internal examination. If at that time Miss Parr
was in a state of pregnacy and it had advanced so far as the
umbilical cord was of the length of eight or ten inches and about
the size of a pencil, or a little larger, and she was able at that
time to perform her usual duties and was attending her regular
vocation and apparently in good health, it was not necessary for
the purpose of saving her life to have performed an operation for
the purpose of bringing about a miscarriage. If at that time the
condition as stated with reference to the advanced stages of preg-
nacy existed, any one called to dilate her womb for the purpose
of menstruation would ha ve ascertained, or should have a scer-
tained, that she was in a pregnant condition at that time. The
first visit on Saturday morning when I saw her she was in that
septie dying condition, - practically pulseless. I told her of


-25-
her condition and she seemed to realize it. I told her she was
dying; she made a statement to me at that time,- she said that
Dr. Waters had produced the abortion and I asked her " how did he
do it and she said dilated her and I asked her if it hurt much
and she said " not much." She said the operation was performed
in Dr. Summerlin's office. I had a talk woth Dr. Waters after that
time, - Saturday evening, - that same Saturday afternoon, aome where
around four o'clock. Dr. Waters and Dr. Carl Holliday came into
my private office and the conversation was in regard to Miss Viola
Parr, and I stated to Dr. Waters what Miss Parr said as her dying
statement, that Dr. Summerlin was responsible for her condition
and that Dr. Waters had produced the abortion by dilating her; and
he said yes, it was true he did dilate her in Dr. Summerlin's office, -
said he sterilized his instruments before he did it. He said at
that time that Dr. Summerlin called him. Some days after that I
talked with him in his office and he repeated the same thing except
that time he said the young lady called him and I called his at-
tention to the fact he told me in my office he said Dr. Summerlin
called him and he said " I am not right positive as to which one
did call me." He said he was Dr. Summerlin's physician, he had
been giving him treatments and sometimes Dr. Summerlin would call
him himself and make an engagement and sometimes he would have his
office girl to call him and make an engagement and he wasn't right
positive as to which one called him on that special occasion. He
made no ment'ion of Dr. Summerlin being in and out of the office
at the time of the operation. I asked Miss Parr when she made her
confession where was Dr. Summerlin, and she said he was in and
around about there.
Cross by Mr. Shackelford:
I have been in Dr. Summerlin's office a few tunes,

He has three or four rooms,- I am not sure, he has a general
reception room where you go in. The X-Ray when I was there was
down to the left as you go in, - it connects off from the reception
room. He has a dental room that connects off on the other side, -
in to the right of the reception room. When Dr. Waters came to
my office he talked very freelyabout it,- didn't seem to make any
effort to conceal anything. He stated there to me then and subse-
quently and all the time that he did perform a dilation. I call a
dilation an operation. Sometimes a dilation will induce an abor-
tion. He explained to me what he did on that occasion. He said
he didn't know she was pregnant,- said he had nothing to put him
on notice she was pregnant, that she was a woman of good standing.
In the general conversation he said that he had seen the girl
about on the streets, - said he knew her brothers and all that, and
he had no reason to suspect anything. He didn't mention Dr. Summer-
lin. He said he had no reason to suspect there was anything the
matter with the girl. It was when Dr. Summerlin wanted to take
his treatment that I understood Dr. Waters to say that is when the
young lady called him or Dr. Summerlin. I understood he went to
Summerlin's office to give Summerlin a treatment but in the subse-
quent conversation he made an engagement for Summerlin to go to
his office. It was just my misunderstanding. It was a question
in Water's mind as to who called him in reference to Dr. Summerlin
taking his treatment, whether the young lady or Dr. Summerlin him-
self, he couldn't remember which it was,- the statement Miss Parr
made was Dr. Summerlin was responsible for her condition. She said
Dr. Waters produced the abortion and I asked her how it was done
and she said he dilated the womb and I said " did it hurt you" and
she said "not much". I made no examination of her myself, no more
than I just stated. I made no diagnosis to determine whether or not

the abortion had been intentionally or criminally performed.
I
don't think an examination, would have demonstrated whether the
abortion was intentional or criminal. I think a dilation where
it was done for the intent for ordinary treatment or curetage,
the same methods would be used as to produce an abortion and I
don't see that you could tell any difference. The same signs would
be left. I found nothing except that is usually found from the
ordinary and legal dilation of the womb, I wouldn't be forced to any
conclusion that an illegal abortion would have been performed, not
from any inspection of that kind. It would be other circumstances
to make me think it had been. The dilation of the womb is not an
unusual thing. That is done professionally from a medical point of
view often. It is done on account of long suppressed menses. Where
you have bleeding from the inside lining of the womb you frequently
dilate and curette to relieve that condition, and a woman who wanted
to deceive her physician could tell him that she was suffering from
that excessive bleeding and get a curetage which would produce an
abortion, if he believed everything she said. I have had cases of
flu, quite a good many. Flu suppresses menses in some cases and
causes menorrhagias in others. That is excessive flow. Its tendency
in childbirth without regard to criminal abortion brings about a
tendency to naturally abort. I had several cases of that kind.
Flu produces a poison of the blood itself through this special
Spanish Influenza germ. I havn't done any autopsies. The general
practice has found that, to be true, where no autopsies have been
. done there have been a great many undertakers who have had occasion
to examine the body, after death. I know as a general matter of
knowledge they have found that condition of the blood. Spanish
Influenza of itself has a tendency to naturally cause or bring about
an abortion. There are a great many other things that will bring
about abortions, miscarriages and things of that kind. Kidneys if
not in condition will do it. Albuminura in the kidneys, is a con-
sequence of the condition you speak of, -syphillis and a great many

other things, - falls, and jars of different kinds and some times
you have a dead foetus you don't know how to explain. A doctor has
to go by certain objective signs about pregnancy. Sometimes a woman
by subjective signs would know she was pregnant, and yet a doctor
would not know it by the ordinary objective signs, unless he had
made an examination for that purpose. I don't know about what the
majority of doctors have found through their examinations. We have
one pathognomonic sign we determine at six week's development, -
when we make a special examönation for it, but the sign as far as
the abdomen is concerned in the first ten weeks, the foetus is so
small it makes no appreciable show, - it doesn't make any show at
all,- really you get a little descent instead of an elevation. When
a woman is in the dorsal position it would tend additionally to
minify the obtrusion, if there was any. If up and down on her feet
up to the fourth month it would be in the pelvis, - really the third
month a descent, and begins to ascend after the third month and after
the fourth month you feel it above. No objective signs up to that
time as far as pregnacy is concerned. It would take a special
examination to determine. You dont't get the foetal heart sound as
early as four months, - takes a fellow with keener ear than mine to
get it the fifth month, - some probably claim it but I have tried
it and can't find it,- it is so faint my ear is not acute enough to
catch it. If a woman of respectabillity and good character, against
whom there hadn't been a breath of suspicion, should go to an inex-
perienced doctor about a thing that wouldn't cause suspicion and
there were no objective signs of pregnacy, and there wouldn't be if
only ten weeks, he might very easily be deceived as to whether or
not the woman was pregnant.
If you had to determine by a diagno-
sis, whether there was any pregnancy, you would have to make cer-
tain examinations before you could tell. In other words the cessa-
tion of the monthly flow is not a positive sign of pregnancy,, that
can be caused by a great many things. You could name a hundred
