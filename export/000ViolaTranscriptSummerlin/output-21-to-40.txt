time a pregnant woman, by then and there using and employing an
instrument and instruments to the grand jurors unknown, which
said instrument and instruments were by the said W.G.Waters and
M, T. Summerlin used and employed for the purpose and with the
intent thereby to produce the miscarriage and abortion of the
said Viola Parr, and by the use and employment of said instrument
and instruments on the person of the said Viola Parr did thereby
cause and produce the miscarriage and abortion of said Viola Parr
and did thereby kill the said Viola Parr, the use and employment
of said instrument and instruments not being then and there neces
essary to preserve the life of the said Viola Parr and not having
been advised by two physicians to be necessary for that purpose;
said W.G.Waters and M.T. Summerlin in the manner and form afore-
said the said Viola Parr did unlawfully, feloniously and will-
fully kill, contrary to the laws of said state, the good order,
peace and dignity thereof.
Involuntary manslaughter shall consist in the killing
of a human being without any intention to do so, but in the
commission of an unlawful act, provided that where such involun-
tary killing shall happen in the commission of an unlawful act
which, in its consequences, naturally tends to destroy the life
of a human being, the offense shall be deemed and adjudged to be
murder.
The law provides that if any person shall willfully
administer to any pregnant woman any medicine, drug or substance,
or anything whatever, or shall employ any instrument or means
whatever, with intent thereby to produce the miscarriage or
abortion of any such woman, unless the same shall have been nece
essary to preserve the life of such woman, or shall have been
advised by two physicians to be necessary for that purpose, he
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
I charge you, therefore, gentlemen, if there is any
person who does the acts which are pre hibited in the section of
the code, which I have just read to you, that such person commits
an unlawful act, and I charge you that it is not necessary, in
order to make the offense defined and punished by that section,
that it should appear that the foetus in the mother's womb was


quick, but all that is necessary to be shown, in order to be
an unlawful act under that section, is that the woman was a
pregnant woman, even in the first stages of pregnancy, and if
the acts are done which are prohibited in that section on such
woman, the doing of those acts would be an unlawful act, although
the child do not be quick in the mother's womb. I, therefore,
charge you that if in the doing of the unlawful act prohibited
in this section death resulted to the mother, but that there was
no intention to kill, that the person responsible for the death
would be guilty of the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the
commission of an unlawful act.
The third count in this indictment is as follows: And
the grand jurors aforesaid, in the name and behalf of the citizens
of Georgia, do further charge and accuse the said w.G. Waters and
M, T. Summerlin with the offense of assault with intent to murder,
for that the said w.G.Waters and M.T. Summerlin, in the county and
state aforesaid, on the 20th day of February in the year of our
Lord, 1919, did then and there with force and arms and with a
certain instrument and instruments to the grand jurors unknown
unlawfully and with malice aforethought in and upon Viola Parr,
a woman pregnant with a child and with the intent thereby to
destroy such child and by the use of such instrument and instrum
ments in and on the person of Viola Parr the death of said Viola
Parr, the mother, was thereby produced, the use and employment
of said instrument and instruments not being then and there nec-
essary to preserve the life of such mo ther and not having been
then and there advised by two physicians to be necessary for saia
purpose, and the grand jurors aforesaid upon their oaths aforesaid
do say that the said W.G. Waters and M.T. Summerlin in the manner
and form aforesaid unlawfully, feloniously and with malice afore-
theught did commit the crime of assault with intent to murder,
contrary to the laws of said state, the good order, peace and
dignity thereof.
The law provides any person who shall administer to any
woman, pregnant with a child, any medicine, drug, or substance
whatever, or shall use or employ any instrument or other means,
with intent thereby te destroy such child, unless the same shall


have been necessary to preserve the life of such mo ther, or shall
have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for such
purpose, shall, in case the death of child or mother be thereby
produced, be guilty of an assault with intent to murder.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that in order to
convict a person of a violation of that section upon which the
third count in this indictment is based that it is necessary for
it to appear to the satisfaction of the jury and beyond a reasen-
able doubt that the child was quick in its mother's womb, - that
is, that it had reached such a state of development as that it
had moved in it's mother's womb before the alleged crime was
committed.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that it is incum
bent upon the State to prove to your satisfaction and beyond a
reasonable doubt every material averment in any or all of the
counts in the indictment that would be necessary to make out the
particular offense in the count which you may have under consid.
eration, and this must be shown to your satisfaction and beyond
a reasonable doubt.
Evidence is of two kinds, direct and circumstantial.
Direct evidence is that which immediately points to the question
at issue. Circumstantial evidence is that which only tends to
establish the issue by proof of various facts, sustaining by
their consistency the hypothesis claimed,
The law does not expect or require mathematical certain-
ty in legal investigations, and all that the law does require is
moral and reasonable certainty, but in criminal cases the law
requires that degree of moral and reasonable certainty which
satisfies the mind and conscience of the jury of the guilt of the
accused beyond a reasonable doubt,
To warrant a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the
proved faets must not only be consistent with the hypothesis of
guilt, butmust exclude every other reasonable hypothesis save
that of the guilt of the accused.
Whether dependent upon positive or circumstantial evidene
the true question in a criminal case, not whether it be possible


that the conclusion at which the testimony points may be false,
but whether there is sufficient testimony to satisfy the mind and
conscience beyond a reasonable doubt.
You are instructed, gentlemen of the jury, that it is for
the Court in the first instance to determine whether the prelim-
imary proof is sufficient to admit dying declarations, but this
ruling is not binding upon you, for you must be satisfied that
such statement was actually made by the deceased, and that she
was in the article of death and conscious of her condition at the
time of making such declara tien. The rule laid down in our Code
is this: Dying declarations, made by any person in the article
of death, who is conscious of his condition, as to the cause of
his death, and the person who killed him, are admissible in this a
prosecution for the homicide.
Great caution is necessary in the admission and use of
this kind of testimony. It is not necessary that the person
whose statements are sought to be introduced should express hime
self as believing that he is in a dying condition. Consciousness
of his dying condition may be inferred from the nature of the woun
-d, or from other circumstances. Dying declarations, when the
jury is satisfied they are such, are founded on the necessity of
the case and the reason that being made in view of impending death
and judgment, when the hope of life is extinct and when the
retributions of eternity are at hand, they stand on the same
plane of solemnity as statements under oath,
I charge you that if you find in your investigation of
the evidence any dying declarations which come up to the stand-
ard as fixed by the rules that I have laid down to you, you are
authorized to consider such declarations along with the other
evidence in the case, so far as your deliberations relate to the
first and second count in the indictment, that is the count for
murder and the count for involuntary manslaughter in the commis-
sion of an unlawful act. The law allows this class of statements
in a prosecution for homicide, and I charge you that a count for
murder would be a prosecution for a homicide, and a count for
involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act
10


would be a prosecution for a homicide. However, I charge you
that you must not consider any evidence of dying declarations,
if there are such before you, on the third count in the indicte
ment, because I charge you that the Legislature has denominated
the crime setforth in the statute, which is the foundation of
the third count, assault with intent to murder and that a
prosecution for assault with intent to murder is not a prosecu-
tion for a homicide, and, therefore, in your consideration of
the third count you must not consider any evidence of any dying
declarations, if you find such dying declarations in the evidence
On the third count I charge you that the word child as
used in the section of the section of the Code which I have
read, relating to the third count, means a living child; that is
to say, an unborn child so far developed as to be ordinarily
called quick, which has developed to that stage where it has
moved in its mother's womb, and which is still alive when the
alleged unlawful means as alleged in the presentment were alleged
to have been employed to produce the alleged abortion upon the
person of said Viola Parr as set out in the third count of the
presentment. And I charge you that the burden is upon the
State to satisfy your minds to the exclusion of a reasonable
doubt that the child with which the said Viola Parr is alleged
to have been pregnant was such a child at the time it is alleged
in the presentment that such abortion was produced, - that is,
was so far developed as to be quick; that is to say, that the
child was quick as hereinbefore explained to you, and if the
State has not so satisfied your minds that the alleged child
was quick, as explained to you, then you would be authorized to
find the defendant not guilty on that count,
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that flight, if
shown to the satisfaction of the jury and beyond a reasonable
doubt, may be considered by the jury on determining the issue
of the guilt or innocence of the accused; and the jury may
determine from all of the facts and circumstances relating to
flight, if it has been shown, whether the flight was the result
of a consciousness of guilt or the result of other causes. But
flight is always subject to explanation. The weight to be given


it and whether the jury will draw an inference of consciousness
of guilt or not is a matter for the determination of the jury.
It is for the jury to determine whether the flight of the defend-
anty was due to a sense of guilt er to other reasons, and if the
jury should be satisfied that the flight was due to other reasons
than a sense of guilt, then the jury should draw no inference
hurtful to the defendant from the fact of flight, if it has been
established,
A person may be a principal in an offense in two degrees.
A principal in the first degree is the actor or absolute per-
petrator of the crime.
A principal in the second degree is he
whe is present, aiding and abetting the act to be done, which
presence need not always be an actual immediate standing by,
within sight or hearing of the act; but there may be a constructiv
e presence which would be sufficient to make a party a principal
in a crime. By a constructive presence is meant such a state of
facts as to the place at which the alleged principal was and his
relation to the offense as that the jury would be authorized to
find that although actually not present at the very place that
the alleged crime was committed that he was in legal contempla-
tion present at the commission of the offense,
I charge you that the indictment in each count in this
case charges the two defendants with being principals in the first
degree. But I also charge you that under an indictment against
a person for principal in the second degree that that person may
be found guilty, if the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt
that he is guilty of the offense charged, as principal in the
second degree.
When witnesses appear and testify they are presumed to
speak the truth and it is the duty of the jury to believe them,
unless they have been impeached in some of the methods prescribed
by law, er are otherwise discredited in the judgment of the jury.
A witness may be impeached by disproving the facts testified to
by the witness, but where a witness is thus sought to be impeach-
ed the witness may be corroborated by facts and circumstances
appearing in the case, or by evidence which the jury may consider
in determining whether they will believe the witness who is the
er 12


subject of the attack.
It is the duty of the jury to reconcile the testimony in
a case and to determine this without imputing perjury to any
witness and without imputing a false statement to the accused.
However, if in your investigationsof the case you find a conflict
between the witnesses which you cannot reconcile, then it is your
duty to believe that witness or those witnesses that you may think
best entitled to belief, and in passing upon the question as to
what witnesses you will credit or discredit, you may consider the
demeanor of the witness on the stand, the relation of the witness
to the case, the interest of the witness in the result of the case
the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the testimony which
the witness gives, the probability or improbability of the
testimony which the witness gives, the familiarity or want of
familiarity of the witness with the facts about which the witness
testifies, the prejudice or bias of the witness, if any has
appeared, and the personal credibility of the witness so far as
the same has legitimately appeared during the progress of the
present trial. But the jury are at last the sole and exclusive
judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be
given their testimony.
The defendant has made a statement in this case, which
the law gave him a right to make, - the law providing that in all
criminal trials the defendant may make to the court and jury just
such statement as he sees proper in his own defense. It is not
under oath. He is not subject to be cross-examined unless he
consents to be cross-examined. But the jury are authorized, if
they see proper to do so, to believe the statement of the accused
in preference to the sworn testimony. The weight to be given the
statement of the accused is a matter entirely for your consider-
ation and determination. You may believe it all, if you see proper
to do so, or you may disbelieve it all, if you see proper to do
so, or you may believe it in part and disbelieve it in parto
Now, gentlemen of the jury, I charge you that you must
render a verdict on each one of the counts in this indictment.
I charge you, therefore, in your investigations to take up the
13


10
first count, which charges the offense of murder, and if after
giving due consideration to all of the evidence and the statement
of the accused you reach the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged in the first
count, then you would be authorized to so find, and in that event
the form of your verdict would be, we, the jury, find the defend
ant, M.T. Summerlin, guilty of murder the first count. A verdict
in that form would be followed by the infliction of the death
penalty. Now, in a murder case the law gives the jury the right
to change the punishment from death to imprisonment for life in
the penitentiary. The law gives you a discretion to make this
change. You may make the change for any reason that is satisfac-
tory to your minds. If you find the defendant guilty under the
first count and see proper to exercise the discretion which the
law gives you and change the penalty from the penalty of death
to imprisonment for life, then the form of your verdict would be
we, the jury, find the defendant, M.T. Summerlin, guilty of
murder under the first count and recommend that he be imprisoned
in the penitentiary for life.
If, on the other hand, after giving due consideration
to all of the evidence and the prisoner's statement you are not
satisfied that the defendant is guilty of the offense of murder,
or if you have a reasonable doubt on your minds as to whether he
is guilty of the offense of murder, then you would be authorized
to acquit him on that count, and in that event the form of your
verdict would be, we the jury, find the defendant, M.T. Summerlin,
not guilty of murder under the first count.
After you have disposed of the first count in the
indictment by whatever verdict you may find, then take up the
second count, which charges the offense of involuntary man.
slaughter in the commission of an unlawful act, and, if, after
giving due consideration to all of the evidence and the prisoner's
statement, you reach the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant is guilty under that count, you would be
authorized to so find, and in that event the form of your verdict
would be, we, the jury, find the defendant, M.T. Summerlin, guilty


11
of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful
act under the second count:
On the other hand, if you are not satisfied of his
guilt under that count, or if you have a reasonable doubt on your
minds as to his guilt, you would be authorized to acquit him, and
in that event the form of your verdict would be, we, the jury,
find the defendant, M.T. Summerlin, not guilty of involuntary
manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act under the
second count.
Having disposed of the second count by whatever verdict
you may find, then take up the third count, and if you are
satisfied in your minds beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt
of the accused under that count, after giving due consideration
to all of the evidence and the prisoner's statement, then you
would be authorized to so find, and in that event the form of
your verdict would be, we the jury, find the defendant, M.T.
Summerlin, guilty of assault with intent to murder under the
third count. Now, I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that in
a case of assault with intent to murder, the law vests the jury,
if they see proper to exercise it, with the right to recommend
that the defendant, if he is found guilty, be punished with a
misdemeanor punishment. This right is given to you and may be
exercised by you for any reason satisfactory to your mind. I
charge you, however, that your recommendation is not absolutely
binding upon the judge, for if you should find the defendant
guilty of assault with intent to murder under the third count
and recommend that he should be punished as for a misdemeanor,
that the judge, no twithstanding your recommendation, would have
the right to inflict a felony punishment if he felt that it was
his duty so to do. But if you see fit to make this recommendation
for due consideration by the judge at the time he imposes
sentence, then the form of your verdict would be,we the jury,
find the defendant, M.T. Summerlin, guilty of assault with intent
to murder under the third count and recommend that he be
punished as for a misdemeanor.
On the other hand, if you are not satisfied of the
guilt of the accused under the third count, or if you have a
15


12
reasonable doubt on your minds as to the guilt of the accused
under the third count, you would be authorized to acquit him,
and in that event the form of your verdict would be, we, the jury
find the defendant, M.T. Summerlin, not guilty of assault with
intent to murder under the third count.
Now, gentlemen, you have found out from the forms of
verdict I have given you that in whatever verdict you find on any
of the counts name the defendant, because there are two defendants
in this bill and the defendant, M.T. Summerlin, is the only one
that is now on trial,
Gentlemen of the jury, you may retire and consider
your verdicts.
(The jury, after being in their rooms for about two
hours and a half, return into court and the following
occurs:)
The Court: Mr. Foreman, I understand you wanted to ask
for some further instructions.
Mr. Foreman: Yes,sir. We would like for you to go over
the charge to a certain extent. There are some points
that are not absolutely clear to some of them,
The Court: On what points do you wish instruction ?
Mr. Foreman: We would like some instruction as to the
law of the first count, second count and third count.
We would like that fully covered, if you please,
The Court: You want the entire charge read ?
Mr. Foreman: I believe they would prefer to have it, -
te heve the entire charge read.
(Reporter reads the entire charge to the jury as it
is setforth above).
The Court:
Now, gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the
entire charge read. I give you these additional instructions in
(second)
reference to the third count, and if there is any difference
between what I say now and what I said in the original charge
you follow the instructions I give you now.
Involuntary manslaughter shall consist in the killing
of a human being without any intention to do so, but in the
16


13
commission of an unlawful act.
I charge you that the law declares it unlawful for any
person to willfully administer to any pregnant woman any medicine,
drug or substance, or anything whatever, or to employ an instru-
ment or means whatever, with intent thereby to produce the
miscarriage or abortion of any such woman, unless the same shall
have been necessary to preserve the life of such woman, or shall
have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for that
purpose.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that those acts
which have been described in the section of the Code that I
have read in your hearing would constitute an unlawful act
within the meaning of the law, and if those acts are done by a
person so denounced to be unlawful and as a consequence of such
unlawful act the death of a person resultså, then the person
committing the unlawful act would be guilty of the offense of
involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act,
provided that if the unlawful act referred to is found by you to
the
be an act which naturally tends to destroy life of a human being,
then the offense would be deemed and adjudged to be murder.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that under the
first count, which is the count for murder, that it must be shown
to your satisfaction and beyond a reasonable doubt that either
there was an intention to kill, or that the facts and circumstance
-s relied upon to support the first count develop a state of
facts where the intent to kill and the malice, which is required
in murder, would be supplied by the commission of an unlawful act,
which, the jury believe is established to their satisfaction
beyond a reasonable doubt, is an act which, in its consequences,
naturally tends to destroy the life of a human being.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that you cannot find
the defendant guilty on both the first and second count,- that
in order to find the defendant guilty on the first count there
must be, as I say, evidence which would show an intention to
kill, or such a state of facts in connection with the perform-
ance of an unlawful act which would supply the evidence of


14
intention and malice, that is an unlawful act which naturally
tends to destroy the life of a human being. The gist of the
effense under the second count is the killing as a result of an
unlawful act but the intention to kill would not be present.
And, therefore, the two offenses charged would be inconsistent
with each other, and, therefore, I charge you that if you find
the defendant guilty under the first count that you would find
the defendant not guilty under the second count, and that if you
find the defendant guilty under the second count that you would
find him not guilty under the first count.
Now, you take these instructions in connection with the
general instructions, which have already been read to you, and
apply these principals of law to the evidence and the prisoner's
statement and reach your conclusions as to what you believe to
be the true verdict in the case,
The Court: Is there any further instructions you wish ?
Mr. Foreman: I believe that is all. I believe that
covers the ground,

April Term, 1919.
W. G. WATERS AND
M. T. SUMMERLIN
The defendant, M. T. Summerlin, was alone
placed on trial. The presentment under which he was
tried was in three counts:
lst. Murder;
2nd. Involuntary manslaughter in the commission
of an unlawful act;
3rd, Assault with intent to murder, based
under the provision of $81 of the Penal Code of Georgia
of 1910.
The jury returned a verdict of not guilty of
murder under the first count; and a verdict of guilty
of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an
unlawful act under the second count; and a verdict of
not guilty of assault with intent to murder under the
third count.
The defendant, M. T. Summerlin, being content
with the verdict of not guilty under the first count
and under the third count, but being dis-satisfied with
the verdict of guilty of involuntary manslaughter in
the commission of an unlawful act under the second count,
filed his original motion for a new trial, which was
approved by the court and assigned for a hearing in
vacation on the 21st day of June, 1919.

Now comes the defendant, M. T. Summerlin,
and moves to amend his original motion for a new trial
under the verdict of guilty of involuntary manslaughter
in the commission of an unlawful act under the second
count of said presentment, by adding there to the
following grounds, to-wit:
-4-
Because the court refused to allow the witness,
W. E. Jackson, sheriff of Clarke County, while on the
stand as a witness for the State, to answer the following
question propounded to him by movant's counsel, to-wit:
"Q. When and how did he (Dr. M. T. Summerlin)
come into your custody as sheriff and jailor of this
county?"
Movant then and there insisted and stated to
the court that if the witness was permitted to answer
said question he would testify that after the presentment
was found against the defendant, M, T. Summerlin, he,
M. T. Summerlin, presented himself to W. E. Jackson,
voluntarily
as sheriff of said county, and surrendered himself to
W. E. Jackson, as sheriff of said county after said
presentment was found against him.

to what the answer of the witness would be if he had
been allowed to testify in response to said question,

dant had been away for some time, for the purpose of
showing flight as evidence of his conscious guilt, and

Movant then and there excepted and here and
now excepts and assigns as error the ruling of the
court in refusing to permit the defendant to prove by
the witness, W. E. Jackson that he (M. T. Summerlin) voluntarily
returned to Athens, Georgia, and surrendered to the
sheriff of Clarke County, Georgia, W.E. Jackson, so
soon as he was aware of said presentment having been
re turned against him as an explanation and in rebuttal
of said evidence of his having fled from the crime as
charged against him.
Movant, therefore, avers that the court committed
error in so ruling.

witness for, State

which was as follows:
to you
"Q. What did she say about dying, if anything?

will and I have got some thing I want to tell you." Says
"I have done wrong and I have been in a pregnant condition"
and I says "who was it"; she says "Dr. Summerlin"; she
says "Dr. Summerlin was the cause of it"; she says "they
performed an operation on me; I said "who was they"
and she said "Dr. Summerlin and Dr. Waters."
Q. What did she say they said to her with reference to
telling it at the time? A. They made her swe ar she

alleged
Objected to the admissibility of the dying
declaration as it would relate to counts two and three
in the presentment and moved to exclude the consideration
of it by the jury in connection with the consideration
of either count No.2 or count No.3 upon the ground that
it is not admissible or competent testimony in view of
the allegations of those two counts, and in addition
that where the graveman of the offense is abortion, that
the declaration of the woman who died as a result of it,
is not competent evidence. The court baningx held that
said dying declaration was admissible as to the second
count and permitted said evidence of said, dying
alleged
declaration to go to the jury and be considered by the
leged
jury as to count No. 2 of said presentment, and excluded
said evidence as to said, dying declaration as to count
No.3), which objections the court then and there overruled.
Movant then and there excepted to said ruling

defendant of a crime in which the gravaman of the
offense is abortion; and where the gravaman of the
offense is abortion the declaration of the woman who
died as a result of the abortion is not competent nor
admissible evidence of the commission of said abortion
nor of the person who produced it; and where the offense
charged is not for the homicide of the declarant but
for the offense of producing and abortion upon her as

of 1910 an assault with intent to murder and punished
as assault with intent to murder in case the death of

objection of movant as applying to the second count of
said presentment, to-wit: The testimony of Dr. J. C.
Holliday as to the dying declaration of Miss Viola Page,
which was as follows:
"And so the following moring Dr. A. C.
Holliday was called out there. He came before I got
there. I expected to meet him there. I was detained
and when I got there he had been there and gone. In
a little while he came back. So, I told Miss Viola we
had done all we could for her and that she was going
to die and the rewasn't anything else that could be
done, that I wanted her to tell in my presence, to
tell Dr. Hollidayu just the truth about it; I says
"let the chips fall where they will." She says "it is
just as I have told you." I said "what did you tell
me." She said "I told you that Dr. Summerlin was
responsible for my condition and that Dr. Waters
produced the abortion." I says "where did he do it";
she says "in Dr. Summerlin's office." So, that con-
cluded our conversation. That concluded the statement
she made to me as a dying statement."
