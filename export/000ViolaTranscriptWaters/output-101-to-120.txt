things possibly,- nervous anxiety could cause suppression and does
some times, - change of place, cold and climate and all those
things. It is true in a general practice, and has occurred often
that some women of perfect good character would want a dilation for
a perfectly innocent purpose and it might turn out she was preg-
nant afterwards,- it is probable. In some instances they do dilate
even when the woman is in that condition. We dilate in a case of
what we call pernicious nausea, when we have resorted to everything
to relieve the nausea and the toxemia is so we have to takr our
chances from the dilation to save the woman's life, - rather than to
produce an abortion. When it comes to a question of producing an
abortion or a dilation we some times dilate with the hope of re.
lieving the reflex condition that keeps up the nausea. Wien the
physician knows the condition of pregnancy is there he has to be
very cautious to keep from producing an abortion. If a physician
didn't know that he would just dilate innocently without regard to
there being a foetus. The consequences might or might not follow
according to the stage of pregnancy. There are a number of ways
in which an abortion can be brought about by falls and jars, and
by conditions intentional by the woman herself, and there are a
number of ways in which an abortion can be brought about by falls
and jars, and by conditions intentional by the woman herself, and
there are a number of ways it could be done intentionally. See
puncture the sac with a sound would be a positive way,- when
you rupture the sad that would let the liquid flow out, and when the
liquid flows out the womb contacts down on it and kills the child.
I only know from authorities that it can be done by electricity.
I have never known it, from my own observation. Authorities say it
can be done and they recommend to be very careful in the use of an
X-Ray over a pregnant uterus. That is, you can use the X-Ray
other parts of the body but not to use it over a pregnant uterus.
That is put down as one of the ways by the authorities to produce
abortion. It is also put down by the authorities that it can pro-
89


-30-
duce sterility temporarily, - thirty days or something like that,
in either of the sexes. The foetus in the early stages of pregnancy
can be destroyed some times very easily by shock, and can be de-
stroyed by drugs, so it will die and stay there.
It could be de-
stroyed by morphine, and stay there. According to the authorities,
the foetus could be destroyed by the powerful ray of an X-Ray
machine, - I have never seen a case of that kind. There are author-
ities on the X-Ray that teach that.
I have no reason to doubt it.
I know from my knowledge of an X-Ray machine that it will break
down tissue, and also cells. There are no more delicate cells
that could be found than in a foetus eight or ten weeks old, - it is
mostly a mass of cells. According to authorities if there had been
the use of an X-Ray machine, or coming in contact with a machine
of that kind, it is entirely possible and probable in the early
stages of pregnancy that would result. If for any reason the foetus
at an early age ceases to develop further, that is, no longer
growing with life, but ceases to grow, no more cells are added, it
is possible that that foetus can some times be carried in the womb
for a great length of time, with the sac not ruptured any way.
Q Barton Cook First is an authority, isn't he ? A Yes, sir.
Dr Hirst relates an incident in India where an English officer's
wife's sac was broken by an Indian physician to demonstrate her
pregnancy, which was denied by the English physician, that she came
back to England with this fluid escaping, she came across the
Atlantic ocean to America, and the foetus was still there and fin-
ally she was delivered of it,- is that an impossible case or not
that occurred in medical history ? A No, that is correct. If the
uterus contracts, the womb contracts,- the body of it. If the body
contracts it would keep that foetus in a more or less preserved
condition, so that sometimes, as the authorities say, it preserves
its rosy appearance when opened. It could be carried there for
several weeks, several months. That fluid is sterile and this foetus
floats in that fluid during the whole time of gestation. If the
90


- 31.-
womb is dilated, the cervix is dilated, and the air gets in there
and oxygen and would immediately set up a decomposition, - it should
be expelled right away; if it didn't you would have some decom-
position, - you would have odors very rapidly but possibly not until
the decomposition had set in. You would liably have very high
fevers and a corresponding pulse, after the infection. You would
not have your temperature until you got the infection. In other
words, the temperature is like a red danger flag that sets up that
shows infection in those cases. It goes to 100 degrees and espe-
cially to 101, all physicians think that is very dangerous. If it.
run up to 103 would be still more so.
@ Now, suppose Doctor, a young woman had been carried home on
Thursday night, nearly dark, and on the next Friday night, she
was found to be in the condition that I have described, 103
fever, and in the condition where there had been a dilation
and opening up of the womb just the day before, and if there had
not
been in that womb a foetus that had been living for some time, would
it not be an indication that septicaemia had set up in that length
of time because of the previous conditions behind Thursday after-
noon ? A In that instance there we have got to have the point
of infection. Insisted foetus, that is a fortus floating in the
amnoitic fluid in the sac inside of the uterus can be dead and
possibly if the placenta where it is attached to the womb is
torn some and then you get your infection which would set up very
quickly a virulent infection.
But the rule is those infections
usually come in from three to four days.
If there had been a di-
lation of the womb and you had any reason to expect infection from
that particular thing, you would expect it usually that septicae-
mia would set up about three or four days afterwards. When it sets
up within twenty-four hours, it is my opinion, you would be put on
notice and suspicion that it might date behind the dilation on
Thursday. In other words, the general rule is that in all of these
puerperal infections it follows in three or four days. I have
91


-32-
never seen a case where it came under three days.
If there had
been a dead foetus in a womb, I don't think a dilation or any other
thing would laave been proper to have emptied the womb as soon as
possible. I would let nature take its course, and expel it. It
there is a dilatation, it would some times set up labor, because
the placenta in those cases very often grows on after the foetus
is dead. When there is a dilatation there is a disposition set up to
contract and expel, because of the dilatation or because of the pla-
centa coming to turn. When you produce that dilatation there and
when that is over with, the womb will contract and the contraction
of the womb, the clamping down of the womb on the placenta causes
that to become detached from the uterine wall and therefore you get
an expulsion of it. No,- when the uterus begins to contract, it has
the effect upon the placenta to detach it and expel it. You under-
stand that the placenta is practically almost a part of the womb;
it is imbedded so close that blood circulates through the uterus,
through the afterbirth and makes its return through the cord,
through the placenta to the mother and throughout the mother's
blood vessels, and on into the lungs. In other words, the mother
does the oxygenating in the blood for the baby; it is almost a part
of the womb, so to speak, and often times at full time when the
uterus expels the placenta it leaves the placentasite, where the
placenta has grown to the womb, it is a raw surface afterwards and
there is some membrane there for weeks or months before it heals
over. When it becomes detached there you have blood. Hemorrhage to
that placental site. After the placenta got out, then the womb
would contract down and close up these bleeding vessels and that
plugs them up and the hemorrhage stops. When the placenta is in the
womb or in the uterus, it can't contract down on that sufficiently
to close up the blood vessels, therefore you continue to bleed until
the placenta is expelled; then the hemorrhage stops. When they
begin to contract and expel the placenta by the action of con-
traction of the uterus, it is such as to separate the placenta,
192


-33-
in to threads and expel it like that. A placenta is what is
commonly known as afterbirth, - it is just simply the shape of
your hand, say, on this side the cord comes out from it with
blood vessels in it and runs to the baby over here and this is
attached to the womb and it becomes imbedded in the early weeks
So tee Hood can beulale from the mother Herough the work
of pregnancy in the words, through this afterbirth, which has
numerous blood vessels, and come to the baby to supply it with
life. The authorities, Williams and Ed gar and Hirst are standard. Q
They put down that there are a great many natural abortions,- some
authors put it down about one to every realbirth and one of the
authorities says from one to five would be about the proportion, -
there are a great many abortions ? A Yes, sir. Q That come from
pregnacy ? A Yes, sir. Q Some authors put down half and half
and some say about twenty- five per cent ? A Various authors give
different figures, - I don't remember what per cent, but quite a
good many. Abortions are induced expecially in the early stages
of pregnancy, either for one reason or another, they very often
are done to save the life of the mother. It is not considered an
act that will in its consequences naturally result in the death of
the mother.
Q I will ask you if the percentage of death, according to Willians,
out of 391 cases is a little over one per cent ? I don't
remember.
Q It is a small fraction of a per cent ? A That is my understand-
ing but I don't remember the per cent.
There are doctors who do tabulate cases from va-
rious hospitals in the country where they have performed abortions
and the per centage is small of death, I don't know whether that is
correct or not. A lot of those cases where those abortions are
performed, the mother is in such condition, pernicious nausea and
various causes why they should produce this abortion; the mother
might die from a toxemic condition she had before the abortion was
produced. If the necessary precautions are taken the danger is


-34-
very much less, Absolutely perfect conditions, very much less. If
there is no infection there can't be any septicaemia. There are
various ways of avoiding infection and you have got to have the
conditions to surround it. But there are often times an infection
that comes from a germ called streptococcus. A real septica emia in-
fection is the streptococcus germ and that is supposed to live on
the outisde and that is carried within.
That is a germ that attacks y
you and makes infection in your hand or toe or anything else.
If you
could keep a bullet wound where there would be no streptococcus
germs in it, it wouldn't be apt to effect it, there are others that
might effect it,- wouldn't be infected from streptococcus germs. The
great thing in any kind of surgery or wounds is the antiseptices, to
keep it in an aseptic condition, but very often inspite of what the
physicain might do, independent of him, infection sets up. A physi-
cian might infect by his hands not being perfectly sterilized. It
is almost an impossibility to sterilize the human hands. We have
got that down pretty fine, - we are not wil ling to risk it,- we
use gloves. If the physician observes every precaution, there
being present streptococcus germs, the patient herself micht infect
herself,- with her hands she could infect herself. She could be
infected from her clothing which has not been sterilized, - she
could be infected from bed clothing not perfectly sterilized, - she
could be infected from being put in an atmosphere where there was
living millions of these streptococcus germs, - especially if she
was close to a stationary wash stand, it would be so, or close to
a sewer closet that could be true. Any place where those germs are
numerous it is very dangerous. An infection might be set up, and
mnobody would absolutely know as to how the infection was set up.
In a case like that it is simply that in the wound or dilation you
get the germs by some means to come in contact with it,- like if you
had a sore on your finger or fresh cut, it would become infected,
and the abrasions on it, if the germ is carried from the outside
and that would innoculate it like you would innoculate on the outside.


-35-
Just would be a question as to how infection set up if infection
finally killed, and the most doubtful question in the world.
You can tell if a man stab a man in the heart, in avital organ, and
life is stopped and swear positively that he was killed by the
knife cut in the heart.
If any other organ that is absolutely
necessary to life is destroyed by a bullet or in any other way,
you can say death occurred straight from that and you could tell
what the proximate cause was.
But when there is a simple operation
called dilatation, you know that it could not be set up except by
infection. Then it would be an almost impossible takk for anybody
to swear with certainty as to how infection was brought about. We
would naturally say the parts were not prepared and that the in-
struments were not clean, or his hands were not clean or something,
or she was in some surroundings or something of that kind. If a
woman in that condition is put in a room where a person has had
erysipelas,- that is practically the same kind of germ, or close
to a water closet or sink and things of that kind. Now, Dr. Waters
told me freely and voluntarily what he did tell me, he came into
my office and told me, - told me just exacly what he had done.
MRS. C.V. FILLINGHAM, sworn for the State, testified:
Direct by Mr. Dean:
My name is Mrs. Fillingham. I was at Mrs. Parrig
during the sickness of Miss Viole. I was first called there on
Friday night. I live out on Princeton rood, about three blocks
from Mrs, Parr. My little giti, Feiday night, went down to the
store and came back and said Viola was home real sick and I told
her I would go down after supper and see her. I was not called.
I wasn't there until about twelve o'clock Friday night. She lived
up until the next Saturdsy morning. During that time, I was there
95


-36-
several times. I stayed there on Saturday night all night, but I
was there off and on during the week and I was there when she
died. When I fent Friday night she was in awful pain, suffering
terribly, and also when I left Friday night. I didn't go back
until Saturday night and she was still suffering the same intense
pain and I stayed all night Saturday night and on Sunday morning
they performed the operation, at least Dr. Holliday performed the op-
eration. I stayed until I suppose something like tvelve or one
o'clock and I went home and came backwards and forvards all during
the week. She still had high temperature and was quite sick all the
time, gradually crew worse from the beginning to the end. I was
present at the time young Dr. Holliday was there and attended her
on Saturd sy night. He removed a quanity of clods and also a cord
about this long (indicating eight or ten inches). That was Satur-
day night after she came home Thursday night. I was there Friday
night and stayed until twelve o'clock. Dr. Carl Holliday did this
work on Saturday night, removed the clods and a cord about this
long very near the size of my little finger. On Sunday morning
he came back and performed the operation. On Saturday night, he
just in some way pulled them out with some kind of instrument, but
I couldn't tell what the instrument was. On Sunday morning he
removed the afterbirth and it was just in pieces and very very
offensive indeed. I was present. Dr Carl Holliday and Dr.
Summerlin. Dr. Summerlin gave the gas.
Cross by Mr. Shackelford:
I live in the neighborhood, about three blocks
from Mrs. Parr; natura 11y went donw there when I heard she was
sick. And found when I got there Friday pight she was sick, and
stayed on until about twelve o'clock. I found her temperature
103, when the doctor was there. On that particular night there
vras nothing done in the way of an operation. I don't know about
96


-37-
what had been done, - Dr. Holliday didn't do anything that night.
I stayed until twelve o'clock Friday night. I was there again
Saturday night. I can't call to memory, whether I was there
during the day or not, - I was there so many times I really have
forgotten. I stayed all night Saturday night,- that is when I
observed this very offensive odor. They were unusually so on
Sunday morning, - on Saturday night they were offensive then but
more so on Sunday morning, - he cleaned out thoroughly in the uterus
at that time. I don't know that I ever observed an odor like that
before, I don't think that I was ever at an operation just like
that before. I was surprised that the odor was there, anybody
would be. At that time I didn't know what had occurred a day or two
before. It was a very strong odor indeed Sunday morning. I saw the
unbilical cord. Saturday night I saw the umbilical cord, - the
blood clots he removed on Saturday night. I didn't see any foetus
or anything like that. I didn't stay there until she died, not all
the time, - I went backwards and forwards during the whole week. I
the
talked with Miss Viola, - I talked with her on Saturday she died, I
was there with her on Friday before she died Saturday. I was there
in a little bit after she made the confession to her mother. I
wasn't in the room when she made the confession, - I was there a while
after she made it, but I wasn't there when she made the confession
and I didn't know she had made the confession until Saturday morning.
Of course, I can't go into the exact time she made the confession
to her mother. I didn't hear the dying confession. I heard her make
a statement after the confession made to her mother, I talked with her
and sit up with them on Friday night until two o'clock. She did not
tell me Dr. Waters had dilated her womb; she never mentioned Dr.Waters
to me.
You were all there as one family with the girl right after the

house.


-38-
Q You heard what was said as to the confession ? A on Saturday
morning I did.
The confession was made on Friday and they told
me on Saturday. Miss Vbola didn't go into any details aftet that
confession to me as to what she had taken, if anything, or as to
what knowledge Dr. Waters had of it. I told you Mrs. Parr told me
on Saturday morning when she was dying that she made a confession
on Friday and I told you I was in the home a while after she made
the confession by what Mrs. Parr said; I wasn't there and didn't
hear the confession and therefore I can't tell you just what time
she made the confession. Mrs. Parr told me that Viola told her
that Dr. Summerlin and Dr. Waters performed an operation on her in
Dr. Summerlin's office on Thursday afternoon, - dilated her womb.
Q Dr Waters and Dr. Summerlin dilated the womb ? A No, sir,
I didn't say that. She did not say she told Dr. Waters her
condition was one of pregnancy,- I don't know what she claimed
but it wasn't told to me.
Re-Direct by Mr. Dean:
Dr, Carl Holliday's instruments, when he came
in to have the instruments sterilized, I had gone in the kitchen
and had the water boiling when Dr. Hollicay came in the room and
ve had a big white bowl and those instruments were placed in
towels in this bowl and the hot boiling water with the antiseptic
tablets put in this bowl and the hot boiling water poured over it
and Dr. Carl also sterilized his hands with the antiseptic tablets
and the hot water. He took the antiseptic cotton with the hot water
and the tablets and sterilized Miss Viola before he ever touched
her. He did that each time; he did that even Saturday night before
he touched her and also Sunday morning.

CHARLES W. PARR , sworn for the State, testified:
Direct by Mr. Dean:
My name is Charley Patt. After the death of my
sister I had a conversation with Dr. Waters. It was in his office.
It was freely and voluntarily made on his part. As I walked into
his room the first thing he said "Charley, let me explain to you";
he said " I am just a tool of Dr. Summerlin" and he said "Dr.
Summerlin phoned for me to come over to his office and perform an
operation, which I did, - I dilated Miss Parr's womb". He said " I
didn't know Miss Parr,- I didn't know she was your sister."
Cross by Mr. Shackelford:
In that same conversation he said he had just been
made a tool of. He siad he didn't know Miss Parr and didn't
know she was my sister. All he did was to dilate the womb; And
that is everything he said.
Re-Direct by Mr. Dean:
I have been knowing Dr. Waters for eight or ten
years; me and him used to be a member of the same lodge. My
brother, Frank, was present at that time.

Re-Croes by Mr. Shackelford:
There was no hesitancy on his part. Just as I
walked in the room, he done all the talking. Just been used, -
he was the tool of Summerlin. He said he didn't know it was my
sister. He done all the talking when I walked in the room. My
brother asked him could he get out of town by Saturday night.
He told me as far as he knew she was absolutely pure. He never
said anything but what I told you. He said he didn't know Miss
Viola Parr and didn't know she was my sister. He said he dilated
Miss Parr's womb.
FRANK PARR, sworn for the State, testified:
Direct by Mr. Dean:
My name is Frank Parr. I was present on the
occasion of the conversation with Dr. Waters just related by
my brother. I heard the statement made by Dr. Waters. It was
freely and voluntarily made. Just as we walked inthe door Dr.
Waters came to Charley, walked towards us, and said "Charley,
let me explain"; Charley said "no, I don't want any explanation";
he said "let me explain any way, - I was just a tool for Dr. Sum-
merlin", - said " Dr. Summerlin phoned for me to come over and per-
form this operation and I went and did it". He said he didn't know
my sister, - didn't know she was Charley's sister. I had known
Dr. Waters, - I never met him but I had known him, - just acquainted.
After that time Dr. Waters left town. I don't know just the exact
time, he remained away from here, - he came back about two weeks ago.

He said he was just a tool of Dr.Summerlin.
I didn't advise him to go off. He didn't leave right after that,-
I think he stayed here about a week or ten days after that.
There was a good deal of excitement about it. No excitement with
us about who was responsible for we knew.
SAN WOODS, sworn for the State, testified:
Direct by Mr. Dean:
My name is Sam Woods; I live in Athens; I know
Dr. W. G. Waters. On or about the first of March this year, I
saw Dr. Waters. I did not have any conversation with him relative
to an operation performed by him on Miss Parr. I took him out
of town, to Vinder to catch a train, - it was about four o'clock
in the morning, - that was before day at that time. I carried him
to Winder. I don't remember what date that was.
Cross by Mr. Shackelford:
That was about fifteen or twenty days after
March ist, I carried him up to Winder. I don't remember whether
or not he told me he hadn't done anything and was perfectly
innocent. I advised him it would be best for him to go away for
a little while. I knew the conditions. The cases hadn't de-
veloped at that time and I advised him to go quietly away, and
come back for trial.
Q And he did come back ?
Mr. Dean: I object to that.
The Court: Yes, I rule that out.
Mr. Shack elford: May I state what I expect to prove ?


-42-
The Court:
Yes.
Mr. Shackelford: (stating the following to the
reporter):
I expect to prove by this witness that
as soon as the indictment was found and the court
house was open he came right back for trial and
surrendered himself to the sheriff and that he only
went away on account of advice and threats of violence.
MRS. G. D. PARR, recalled for the State, testified:
Direct by Mr. Dean: -
My daughter, Viola, last menstruated the first
of September. I know that because I do my own washing.
Re-Direct by Mr. Dean:
She had flu the last of September,- Her condi-
tion when she was sick with the flu was just like a bad cold and
she had some fever; we didn't have a physician with her at all;
I don't know that she did have the flu, but some thought she
did.

Mr. Shackelford: We will let the defendant make his
statement.
W. G. WATERS. defendant, statement :
Gentlemen of this Jury :
I was born and raised in
middle Tennessee. Not being a native of the State I will give you
a little history of my family is the reason I do this. My father
was a farmer and I stayed there and went to school to a country
school what time I could. Our sessions were short and what time
I couldn't attend school in the school and during the day I went
at night and obtained what education I could. My father had six
boys and one girl,- the youngest boy is twenty-nine years old.
This is the first time in the history of this family that there was
ever a man before any court,- never was one of them drunk and before
any court,- never was one arresteck, - never one's name mentioned in
the grand jury,- never one of them drunk and before any court of
any kind or description. At the age of about twenty-one or twenty
I left the farm to take up the study of my profession at Franklin,
Kentucky. I completed that course in 1902. I met my wife in
Kentucky and we married a little later on and four union we have
two dear little girls. After I graduated I first located in Weat
Try
Tennessee near the Mississippi river.
I there contracted malaria
and I stayed there a while, I have forgotten how long, and I found
I couldn't stay in that malaria country,- never had a chill in my
life until I went there. Twenty-seven days after I landed in
Covington, Tennessee, which was in the western part of the state,
twenty-eight miles above Memphis, I stayed there as long as I could
trying to acclimate myself to that climate but I found I couldn't.
I had a temperature at that time with malaria' as high as 106, three
different times, which was a very unusual fever. I came back
home. I left there; I couldn't stay there on account of the climate


-44-
with the malaria. I came back home trying to recuperate and get
my system rid of malaria amd look for a better location where they
didn't have malaria.
I met a man who had been in Athens and I
asked him about it and he told me about the hospitality here, the
good people, the good town and all those things that make a town
desirable for a man to live in.
I decided to cast my lot in
Athens.
I arrived here the 15th day of September 1905.
I have
practiced my profession here since that time, which is about, since
1905.
I have tried to live right, tried to treat my fellow-man
right and I have tried to tell a man the truth.
I go along and
try to attend to my own affairs.
Never been before the court be-
fore except probably as a witness in a case; as far as my having
8 case I never had a case in this court before or in Judge West's
court. As I say, I arrived here in September. I have been prac-
ticing my profession continuously since except probably a month
some summers, because two or three summers I would go away for a
month or so, - continuously here in this city.
This brings us down to this parcicular part of the
case. On the 20th day of February past about twelve o'clock, I
guess some where along about that time, I had a phone message from
Dr. Summerlin's office saying that he wanted to see me for a treat-
ment.
I gave him an engagement and he came over in just a few
minutes.
It might have been eleven o'clock,- somewhere about the
middle of the day.
I have been treating Dr. Summerlin for lumbago
occasionally for several months, I don't know just how long. He
came in and I gave him an engagement and he came in and I got
through with him. As he started out he told me that Miss Parr wanted
to see me at his office and he left. I said "will you tell her,
if you are going back to the office, I will be over there a little
later, that I have to go out on a cell now and I will be over there
about one,- some where between one and one-thirty. " I went on my
other call and got around there about that time. I couldn't say


-45-
what time,- some time between one and one-thirty.
I went in his
reception room and I rang the bell,- which is in the right hand
side of his reception room. He has four rooms; one of them, two
of them face College Avenue, and another one faces this way and
makes it an ell like this and his reception foom is right here, the
X-Ray room here and another room of some kind here, and there is
an operation room around here. I went in the reception room, which
is right here. I rang the bell and Miss Parr responded and I said
"you wanted to see me, did you" and she said "yes"; I said "what
is it"; she sat down there in the reception room. I didn't see or
hear any one. She says to begin with in September or October, some
where back there, she had had flu and had been suffering with her
menstruation since that time. I says "how"; she said very painful
and it made her weak and made her nervous.
I says "when were you
sick last"; she says "three or three and a half weeks ago". -
eomething like that; I wouldn't be exact but three or three and a
half weeks. I says "what about it"; she said "I want you to do a
dilatation of the uterus as I had this dilatation done about a month
ago". That was the 20th day of February that I saw her. She
said "I had this done about a month ago, I wouldn't say exactly
a month, but it might have been twenty-three days or it might hsee
been twenty-eight. She said about a month ago. She told me she was
sick three weeks before that. I said "I can give you an engagement
at my office a little later", - probably half an hour or some time
I have forgotten what and she says "no, I want it done here." She
says "Dr. Summerlin has an operatiing table" as she had had it done
before. She says "I had it done in Dr. Summerlin's office in the
X-Ray room." He has an operating table there for the use of taking
X-Rays, using an X-Ray in making pictures of fractures and so on.
I said, "I rather you come to the office" and she said "no, I want
it done here" and she had an operating table there. I said "well,
I will be back over here in a little while, few minutes." Another

reason I said "why not come on to my office"; she said "it may
hurt me." I said "did it hurt you before"; she said "no,";
she said "it may hurt me though"; I said "it is not necessarily
a painful operation, just a little dilatation"; she said "if it
does hurt me I want to be bere where I ean take gas if it does
hurt me." I said "that is not necessary,- don't know of any pain
about it, however, I will come." I went back to my office and I
got a uterine dilator and I came back within twenty or thirty
minutes, I don't remember how long from the time I left her office
and walked back to my office, - it was twenty or thirty minutes, -
might have been fifteen,- I don't remember exactly how long. I
came back and entered the reception room and rang the bell. She
came to the other door and I said "here is a uterine dilator, little
instrument to dilate the uterus,- you take it and sterilize it", -
knowing that she sterilized, knew how to sterilize. It was wrapped
up in a towel; I said "put that in a sterilizer and boil it." I
told her before I left to fix the water because I have to sterilize
the instrument; she did and when I got back she said "the water is
boiling now in the electric sterilizer." I said "why don't you get
the doctor (to go back a little) that did this dilatation before,-
why don't you get the doctor to do that"; she said " I can't get
him." I wanted to go back a little bit. That was when I made my
first visit to the office,- "why don'tt you get the doctor that dia
the dilation before" and she said she couldn't get him. She took
the instrument and went where she sterilized it in an electric ster-
ilizer she said and she went around that way, I don't know which
room. She sadd " you go in there and fix the table, the operating
table, the way you want it." I went in and found the table and I
spread a little cover over it and fixed the pillow and fixed the
table for the dilatation. She said "how long do you want this to
boil"; I said "five minutes at least" and I said "be sure and immerge

it in the water thoroughly and when you come back bring this
sterile water with you."
She was in there five or six minutes
and brought the water back in a basin and I took a cyanide tablet
which is a strong antiseptic tablet and wa shed my hands with a
brush and cleaned them and made them as thoroughly clean as I
could. I was in there to do this dilatation about, I would say
any where from eight to twelve or fourteen minutes,- not fifteen
minutes at the outside from the time I started. I went on and got
through and I left her and went back to the office. Then it was,
oh, two o'clock probably, some where about that time,- might have
been two-thirty, I don't remember the exact time. I didn't see
Miss Parr any more. Never did see her after that time. I was
there, - I was in there about ten or fifteen minutes,- might have
been eight or ten minutes, - just a few minutes in all. I never
did see her any more.
That brings us down to the 3rd,- this was the
20th day of February; that brings us down to the 3rd day of March,
which was on Monday. I had heard of her death as Dr. Holliday
stated about the conversation in his office Saturday evening. He
asked me, we talked about the case as he said; I said "yes, sir,
I did the dilatation"; I said " I had no idea in the world there
was any trouble with the girl and so far as I knew she was as pure
a's a snow drift from Heaven." No imitation of it,- I saw no
signs 6f it, no physical signs of it, none under the sun. She was
just as pure as any girl in the world. I didn't go into some
details you could have, - not suspicious, - wasn't any suspicion under
the sun that I knew anything in the world about it. That brings
us down to the 3rd day of March, which was Monday. About ten or
eleven o'clock, I was sitting at my desk and Mr. Charley and Mr.
Frank Parr came in and I spoke to them; I was sitting at my desk
and they came in and as they came in they locked the door,- bolted
the doop,- they had just a turn bolt and not a lock,- just a bolt.

They were, one of them especially, was armed with a revolver; I
don't know that the other was,- one of them was.
and I have for-
gotten just exactly how the conversation started.
Charley, I
believe, said " I want to see you a minute";
I said "all right."
He said to me about this.
I said " I have heard about this case
Charley and I want to explain the matter to you a little bit"; I
Said " I told Dr. Holliday in his office the previous Saturday that
I wanted to see you and tell you about it,- I wanted to tell you
the part I played in it and I wanted to tell you exactly what I
did". "I says "Charley, I dilated that uterus and I had no more
idea in the world that that girl was in trouble;- that there was
any trouble with her, I saw no signs or symptons any way of it
and as far as I knew she was as pure as any girl under the sun and
in what I did I was absolutelyinnocent of any wrong-doing." Well,
they said to me "we are going to give you a week to leave town."
I says "Charley, I havn't done anything, - if there is anything, I
was innocent of it." "We are going to give you a week to leave
town, - we don't want to see you here after that." This was on
the 3rd day of March. I said "Well, I will see, I don't want any
trouble, - I don't want to have anything in any way,- don't want any
tragedy."
They said "you have got to leave town."
One of them
had a gun on him. I saw it. The other one I didn't see any gun on
him. About that time somebody knocked at the door. They were in
my operation room at my office, which is in the Holman building.
I started to the door and Charley said "no, you can't get out of
here"; I said "what is it"; he said "we want to see you away in a
week." That was the 3rd of Warch. I said "I will see about it,
I don't want any trouble". Charley and I have been good friends
and I havn't had any animosity and don't until this day hold any
animosity towards him.
I went on and I was informed on the 4th
day of March, which was on Tuesday, that they rescinded this action
and for me not to leave town. That word was sent to me to rescind
