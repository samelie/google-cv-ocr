Because the Court erred in charging the jury
as follows, to-wit:
"It is the duty of the jury to reconcile the
testimony in the case and to do this without imputing perjury to any
witness and without imputing a false statement to the accused, but
if in your investigations of the name evidence in the case you reach
a conflict that, you cannot reconcile, then it is your duty to believe
that witness or witnesses that you think best entitled to belief."
This charge was error for the reason that it
weakened the effect of the defendant's statement, because the Court
told the jury in effect that where there was a conflict between the
statement of the accused and the witness, that they could not reconcile,
that it was their duty to believe that witness or witnesses best
entitled to belief. There being a conflict between the statement of
the accused and the witnesss for the State, as claimed by the State,
the effect of said charge was to set aside and to nullify the defendant's
statement. This charge was not cured afterwards by the instructions to
the jury as to what weight could be given a defendant's statement. This
was a general charge without reference to the statement conflicting with
the witnesses. This error was of such a nature that it could not be
cured except by a direct withdrawal of it from the jury by the Court,

perpetrator of the crime. A principal in the second degree is he who
is present aiding and abetting the act to be done, which presence need
not be always an actual immediate standing by within sight or hearing
of the act; but there may be in law a constructive presence".
This charge was error because there was no evidence
given in said case and none in the brief of evidence hereby referred to
and made a part of this motion, upon which to base such a charge. This

error was harmful to the movant because it gave the jury two oppor-
tunities to convict him. They could convict him if he was the principal
actor, but if the evidence was not strong enough to convict him as such,
the jury in effect were instructed that they might convict him as a
prianipal in the second degree even though he had no direct personal
part in the crime that was committed, but that if he was constructively
present at any distance, even though he was not in such distance as to
rend er aid ifi called upon. They jury, under this charge, might have
convicted movant on the ground that he was constructively present at
all of the various things that were being done at the home of Miss
Parr afterwards and which might or might not have caused her death.
It was also error for the Court not to explain to
the jury what was meant by "constructive presence". He should have
explained to the jury that there could be no constructive presence unless
the party who was charged with aiding and abetting was actually physically
present to such an extent as to be able to render aid or assistance.

Because the Court erred in charging the jufy as
follows, to-wit:
"I charge you that under the second count that a
conviction may be lawfully had although there was no intention to kill,
if you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the unlawful act alleged
in the count has been proved, the law would authorize a conviction under
allesguer
that count, even if there was no intention to kill at the time the n-
lawful act was alleged to have been performed."
The error in this charge being that while the Court
charged the jury that they must believe that the unlawful act was
proven beyond a reasonable doubt, he failed and neglected to charge
that in order to convict under this second count the jury would also
have to believe that he was guilty under this count, that he had killed
the deceased in addition to performing at an unlawful act, and that
the jury must believe that what the defendant did actually killed the
i 31


Page 13.
deceased and this beyond a reasonable doubt. The case being one of
circumstantial evidence, the Court shou ld also have charged that the
jury must not only believe the defendant guilty of causing the death
as alleged in this count, but that they must also be satisfied in order
to warrant a conviction that the proved facts must not only be consistent
with the hypothesis of guilt, but must exclude every other reasonable
hypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused. It was harmful error
for the Court not to charge as indicated fully on these two subjects,
because the evidence unmistakably shows that the cause of death was.
problematical and uncertain, and that the death could have been brought
about and in all probability was by a number of causes independent of
and outside of what movant did. There were other reasonable hypothesis,
many of them consistent with the innocence of the accused. There was no
evidence that the deceased died of a mortal wound, but that she died of
septica.emie, and that this could have been set up in more than a dozen
ways independent of what movant did. And in support of this ground
is made

"When witnesses appear and testify they are per
to speak the truth, and it is the duty of the jury to believe them unless
they have been impeached in some of the methods known to the law, or
otherwise discredited in the minds of the jury. A witness may be
impeached by disproving the facts testified to by the witness, but whers
a witness is thus sought to be impeached the witness may be sustained
by the facts and circunstances appearing in the case or by evidence which
satisfies the jury that the witness attacked is telling the truth."
Thé error in this charge being that the Court
failed and neglected to charge one other method of impeaching witnesses
allowed under the law, and which should have been given to the jury in
this case, and that was that a witness could also be impeached by
32


Page 14.
by contradictory statements made by the witness outside of Court, or
in another proceeding. The testimony shows that lurs. G. D. Parr, the
principal witness for the State, appeared before the Grand Jury of Clarke
County on two previous occasions and that her testimony on these two
occasions was entirely different from the testimony given on the stand
in the trial of this case; and that her testimony as given upon the
trial of this case was entirely different from the statements that she
made to tire witness, Mrs. C. W. Fillingham. In her testimony before the
Grand Jury on two different occasions she did not pretend to state the
following in reference to the dying declarations of her daughter: "Marma
I swore not to tell it" "She said, Dr. Surmerlin and Dr. Waters swore
her not to tell it". This was very material testimony but when she
are the fourt
testified before the Srand Jury, to tell, the entire 'transaction, she did
not tell that this happened, and when she related the alleged dying
declarations to Mrs. Fillingham right after they were said to have
been made, she excluded this statement.
16.
Because the Court erred in giving the charge on dying
declarations generally to the jury and not in restricting it to the
particular scount in the indictment which charged murder; said charge
on dying delcarations being as follows, to-wit:
"Our Code provides, dying declarations, made by any person in the
article of death, who is conscious of his condition, as to the cause of
his death, and the person who killed him, are admissible in evidence in a
prosecution for the homicide.
Great caution is necessary in the admission and use of this kind
of testimony. It is not necessary that the person whose statements are
sought to be introduced should express himself or herself as believing
that he or she is in a dying condition, Consciousness of the condition
of the person who is alleged to have made the statements may be inferred
from the nature of the wound, or from other circumstances. Dying
declarations, when the jury is satisfied that they are such, are founded
on the necessity of thecase and the reason being that being made in view
of impending death and jud ment, when the hope of life is extinct and
when the retributions of eternity, are at hand, they stand on the same
plane of solemnity as statements made under oath."
It was error for the Court to apply this charge to
Count two of the indictment, charging involuntary manslaughter, The
Court should have restricted this charge to Count One wherein murder
is charged, for the reason that the facts set forth in Count of
33

Page 15.
of the indictment do not constitute the offense of involuntary man-
slaughter, but that if any offense is charged therein, it is the offense
of assault with intent to murder, as contained in Section 81 of the Penal
Code, or else the misd emeanor contained in Section 82 of the Penal Code.
And although said Count may denominate the crime therein as involuntary
manslaughter, yet, under the rule of law it makes no difference what it
is named, the charges set forth therein make the real crime; and that
dying declarations are inadmissible except in homicide cases, and there
near legal
being no charge of homicide in Count Two, but the gravamen of said
offense being abortion and not homicide, dying declarations should have
bean restricted to the first count in the indictment.

Because the Court erred in charging the jury as follows:
cel
"I, therefore, charge you that if one violates that pro-
vision of the code which I have just read, and commits the unlawful act
therein provided, and as a consequence of that unbwful, the death of the
mother results, that that would constitute the offense of involuntary
manslanghter in the commission of an unlawful act."
This charge of the Court was preceded by the Court
reading Section 82 of the Penal Code.
This charge was error for the reason that Section 82
as read by the Court fully defines the entire crime, a crime complete
within itself, a crime differentiated from all other crimes, separate
and distinct, carved out of the criminal law with a specific offense
charged and a specific punishment, and the Court erred in charging that
such a crime as defined under Section 82 could become such an unlawful
act as to make the crime of involuntary manslaughter.
Said charge was also error for the reason that the Court
failed to give to the jury any rule or instructions as to how the unlawful
act which the Court charged might be contained in Section 82 of the Penal
Code, could be established, what rules of evidence were required to make
out said crime, or unlawful act, nor did the Court charge that it was
necessary that said unlawful act or crime as contained in Section 82


Page 16.
should be proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That it was
error not to charge the jury that the unlawful act as charged upon by
the Court under Section 82 must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,
that it was a material allegation in the indictment, and that the law
required it to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,
The Court also erred in said charge in allowing the

same to be established by dyink declarations of v a s. Parr, Said
unlawful act as contained in the Penal Code of Section 82 not being a
Hout a misdegneanor
homicide, dying declarations were inadmissible to establish it and it
was error in the Court even after he had admitted dying declarations
not to restrict the application of this dying declaration to the homicide
alone. The Court should have charged the jury that the burden was upon
the State anck to prove the unlawful act as set forth in Penal Code,
Section 82, by evidence, either st o r circumstantial, and this to
the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and that in no
event could they consider the dying declarations in ing to establish
this alleged unlawful act, but that the unlawful act must first be
established in their minds by proof and that afterwards when they came
to consider the charge on homicide, they might then consider dying
declarations.
18.
Because the Court erred in charging the jury as follows,
to-wit:
"After you have done this, your finding on the third
count will be, 'We, the jury, find the defendant, W. G. 'Waters, not
guilty under the third count' as the Solicitor does not insist on a
XXXXXXneX conviction under that count, and I charge you that the
evidence is not sufficient to convict under that count."
This charge of the Court was error for the reason that
the Court unwittingly, and without intending it, expressed an opinion. The
jury was led to believe that the Court was compelled under his view and
und er his conscience to instruct them that the evidence was not sufficient
to convict under Count Three, and that as the Court gave no instruction
as to Count Two, the jury were led to believe that the Court could not
.: 35


Page 17.
conscientiously say the same thing as to Count Two, and that therefore
the Court must believe that the defendant was guilty under Count Two,
the Court having previously charged as to Count One and the charge being
such that the jury could not convict under that charge. For the Court
had already charged under that count as follows: "A crime consists in
the violation of a public law in the commission of which there shall be
a union or joint operation of acts and intention or criminal negligence,"
The jury could infer from this language that they could not convict
under Count One, as there was no intention to kill ever shown in the
evidence. Therefore, Count One being eliminated by this charge, and
Count Three being abandoned by the Solicitor, and the Court instructing
the jury that the evidence was not sufficient to convict under this,
the jury naturally came to the conclusion that they must convict under .
the second count, as there no intention to kill was charged.
19.
Because the Court erred in receiving from the jury the
following verdict: "We the jury find the defendant, W. G. Waters, guilty
of involuntary manslaughter in the cormission of an unlawful act as
under the second count." And it being upon this verdict his sentenge,
that the said W. G. Waters should serve three years in the pentientiary,
was base
both said verdict and sentence were illegal and void, for the reason that
the said jury on the first count charging murder, returned the following
verdict: "We the jury find the defendant, W.G. Waters, not guilty of
the offense of murder as under the first count," and at the same time
also rendered the following verdict, "We the jury find the defendant
W. G. Waters not guilty of assault with intent to murder as under the
third count" - all three of these counts were based identically upon the
same facts. It was the same alleged crime on the same person and on the
same date, and the material allegations were the same. The fact that
the indictment divided into three separate crimes did not make three
separate crimes, but only one crime, and that was the crime defined in
the criminal code either under Section 81 or 82, This crime was fully
set out in count one and in count three. The jury by their verdict in
both cases said that the defendant was not guilty. Therefore he could
36

not be guilty under the second count because it was the same charge,
and having been acquitted under counts one and three, the legal effect
of the verdict was to acquit the defendant also under the segond count,

The defendant, therefore, stood acquitted of the entire charges before
the Court and should have been discharged, and the sentence of three
years in the penitentiary is illegal and void, because there is not

Because the Court erred in admitting the alleged dying
declarations of Vista Parr, said alleged dying declarations being
as follows:
"Friday afternoon before she died Saturday afternoon
she had been very ill all day and no one was in the room but me and her
in the afternoon and she says "Mama, I know I am going to die, - the
doctor told me so and I know it myself, and there is something I want
to tell you." I said "Viola, what is it"; she said "I have done wrong
and I have been pregnant", and I says "who was the guilty one"; she
said "Dr. Summer ling"; she says "they performed an operation on ne".
I said, "they, - who were they"; she said "Dr. Summerlinx and Dr.
Waters," I said "where did they perform it"; she said "in Dr.
Bummerlin's office." I said "where was Mary"; she said "she was gone."
Q. What did she say caused Mary to leave?
Mr. Shackelford: We object to the leading question.
The Court: I don't think that question was lead ing.
She didn't say anything only said "ary was gone"
She said "Mama, they made me swear, Dr. Surmerlin and Dr. Waters made
me swear that I would never tell it and I wouldn't have told it if I
had known I was going to live." She died the next day about one-thirty,
I think it was; that was in the afternoon on Friday; - that was all
the statement she ever made to me. She did tell me, - say a few more
words but that was the main thing. I was overcome and company was in
there nearly all the time after that. She said "Mama, I believe God
has forgiven me. She said "Mama, will you love me" XXX I told her
"yes"; she said, "Come and pray with me" and after I prayed with her
she said, "kiss me Mama"
Counsel for mo vant objected then and there to the
admission of said testimony after the foundation for the same had been
laid, on the ground that said dying declarations were not confined to
the act tlal res gestae and was outside of the res gestae and that it should
be confined to the time of the killing, the person who was alleged to
have caused her death, and that the statements as to what was said as
to swearing her did not fall within this rule, and should not be admittede
-
37


Page 20% 19.
In addition to this counsel for movant objected to the admission of said
dying declarations on the ground that if the deceased and the movant
were conspirators for the accomplishment of an unlawful act, and the
conspiracy having already been performed and ended, the testimony would
not be admissible even though the women were in life, she could not
testify as to what had occurred after the conpsiracy was end ed. In
addition to this, counsel for movant objected to the admission of said
testimony on the ground that dying declantions were not admissible in
this kind of a bill but only in cases of homicide, and then should be
confined to the cause of her death and the person who killed her.
The Court overruled these objections, his ruling being
as follows:
"I will allow the entire narrative to go to the jury,
but I will instruct the jury that the law restricts a dying declarations
in case of homicide to two things, the identity of the persons who commit
the homicide, and the means by which the homicide was brought about."
This ruling of the Court was error for the reason above
set forth, and for the additional reason that it was harmful and preju-
dicial to allow an entire narrative and much outside matter to go to the
jury as being proven under thesolemnity of a dying declaration, and
especiallyxmm Krk such matters as are not connected with the identity
of the person who committed the homicide and the means by which the
homicide was brought about. The irrelevant and outside metters contained
in said alleged dying declarations being as follows:
"llery had gone home." "Mama they made me swear, Dr. Summerlin
and Dr. Waters made me swear that I would never tell it and I wouddn't
have told it if I had known I was going to live." "Mama. I beliee God
has forgiven me." "Mama, will you love me": "Come and prey with me,
and after I had paayed with her, she said, "Kiss me Mama."

Because the Court erred in charging the jury as
follows, to-wit:
"Our Code provides, dying declarations, made by any
person in the article of death, who is conscious of his condition, as
to the cause of his death, and the person who killedhim, are admissible
in evidence in a prosecutionfor the homicide.
Great caution is necessary in the admission afid use of
this kind of testimony. It is not necessary that the person whose
statements are sought to be introduced should express himself or herself
as believing that he or she is in a dying condition. Consciousness of
the condition of the person who is alleged to have made the statements
may be inferred from the nature of the wound or from other circumstances.
Dying declarations, when the jury is satisfied that they are such, are
founded on the necessity of the case and the reason being that being
made in view of impending death and judgment, when the hope of life is
extinct and when the retributions of eternitý are at hand", they stand
on the same plane of solemnity as statements made under oath,"
This charge was error for the reason that although the
Court in admitting the evidence of lirs. G. D. Parr as to dying decla-
rations as above set forth in the preceding ground, that he would admit
said testimony but that in his charge he would restrict it to the case
of homicide and to the identity of the person who committed the homicide
and the means by which the homicide was brought about; that the Court
by oversight neglected to so restrict the alleged dying declarations
but allowed the entire narrative to go to the jury under the above
charge with out restriction and with all of the irrelevant statements
as above set forth, which was very prejudicial to the defendant,
especially that part of the alleged dying declaration which the deceased
is alleged to have said: "Mary had gone home" "mama, they made me
· swear, Dr. Summerlin and Dr. Waters made me swear that I would never
tell it, and I wouldn't have told it if I had known I was going to live."
"Meme. I believe God has forgiven me" "Come and pray with me" and "Kiss
me Name.".
All of these statements on account of their pathetic
nature were calculated to unduly influence the jury and to make then
give undue weight to the alleged dying declaration, and they should not
in the first place have been allowed to go to the jury, and this was
error, It was error for the Court not to instruet the jury in accord-
ance with his announced intention, that such matters could not be
considered.

Said charge on dying declarations was also error because the
Court failed to instruct the jury in the same connection that
dying declarations like any other evidence could be impeached,
and the same rules applied to it as to other evidence,
And, also in failing to char ge that the witness giving
to the jury the alleged dying declarations could also be im-
pea ched by her contradictory statements as to such declarations
to other persons at other times-- There being ample evidence to
require this charge.
22
Because the Court erred in failing to give in the charge
txxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXWİNX to the jury the law relating to admission
of confessions and the weight of such evidence. The evidence
on
justified and demanded a chargex/this subject, said evidence
being as follows, to-wit:


The testimony of Charles W. Parr, one of the State's witnesses
on this subject was as follows:-
"My name is Charley Parr. After the death of my sister I
had a conversation with Dr. Waters. It was in his office. It
was freely and voluntarily made on his part. As I walked into
his room the first thing he said "Charley, let me explain to you."
He said "I am just a tool of Dr. Summerlin" and he said "Dr.
Summerlin 'phoned for me to come over to his office and per-
form an operation, which I did, - I dilated Miss Parr's womb."
The testimony of Frank Parr, one of the State's witnesses
on this subject was as follows:-
"My name is Trank Parr. I was present on the occasion of
the conversation with Dr. Waters just related by my brother. I
heard the statement made by Dr. Waters. It was freely and vol-
untarily made. Just as we walked in the door Dr. Waters came to
Charley, walked towards us and said "Charley, let me explain, #
Charley said "No, I don't want any explanation. He said "Let
me explain any way,- I was just a tool for Dr. Summerlin, -"
said "Dr. Summerlin 'phoned for me to come over and perform .
this operation and I went and did it."
The statement of Movant, w. G. Waters with reference to
the circumstances surrounding the conversation with the two
witnesses above quoted is as follows:-
"That brings us down to the 3rd day of March, which was
Monday, About ten or eleven o'clock, I was sitting at my desk
and Mr. Charley and Mr. Frank Parr came in and I spoke to t
I was sitting at my desk and they came in and as they came in
they locked the door,- bolted the door,- they had just a turn
bolt and not a lock, just a bold. They were, one of them es-
pecially, was armed with a revolver; I don't know that the
other was one of them was. "
"I said "Well, I will see, I don't want any trouble, - I
don't want to have anything in any way,- don't want any
tragedy. They said "You have got to leave town". One of them
had a gun on him. I saw it. The other one I didn't see any gun
on him."

The Court should have charged the jury Section
1931 of the Penal Code as follows: "Weight of such evidence. All
admissions should be scanned with care and confessions of guilt should
be received with great caution. A confession alone uncorrobarated
by other evidence will not justify a conviction." And the Court
should have also given in the charge to the jury Section 1032 of the
Penal Code as follows: "Confessions must be voluntary. To make a
confession admissible it must have been made voluntarily without being
induced by another by the slightest hope of benefit or the remotest
fear of injury." The State relied to such a great extent upon the
confession, so called, that the failure to charge the restricting
rule as to this kind of evidence was a great injury to the defendant.
And in such a case the Court should charged upon this subject withot
a written request, aur noh do yo so war Error

Because the Court erred in charging the Jury as follows:
"The commission of an unlawful act which in its conse-
quences naturally tends to destroy the life of a human
being is deemed and adjudged by the law to be mudder."
Said charge was error for the reason that it was clearly
an erronious statement of the lay, and although no doubt was
simply a lapsus linguae of the Court, still it was highly pre-
judicial to Movant. Said charge was error for the reason that
the Court did not qualify said charge by the statement that death
must result from such an unlawful act before it would be mirder.
Said charge was error for the reason that the Jury was lead to
believe from said charge that if Movant had committed an un-
lawful act which naturally tended to destroy human life, that
he would be guilty of murder, regardless of whether such act
resulted in death or not. Especially was this charge error in
view of the evidence of Drs. A. c. and J. C. Holliday, wit-
nesses for the State, which evidence is set out in the 20
ground of this amended motion and is hereby referred to and
made a part of this ground, said evidence showing various causes
which might have brought about the death of deceased, other
than acts of Movant.
-24-
Because the Court erred in charging the Jury on the sub-
ject of Involuntary Manslaughter as follows:-
"Involuntary manslaughter shall consist in the kil.
ling of a human being without any intention to do so, but in
the commission of an unlawful act, provided that where such in.
voluntary killing shall happen in the commission of an unlaw-
ful act which, in its consequences, naturally tends to des-
troy the life of a human being, the offense shall be deemed
and adjudged to be murder.
The law provides that any person who shall wilfully
administer to any pregnant woman any medicine, drug, or sub-
stance wisku or anything whatever, or shall employ any in-
strument or means whatever, with intent thereby to produce
the miscarriage or abortion of any such woman, unless the same
shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such woman,
or shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary
for that purpose, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
. I charge you that any person who violates the pro-
visions of that section of the code that I have just read, com-
mits an unlawful act, and I charge you further that it is an
unlawful act no matter at what stage the foetus in the mother's
womb may be, and it is not necessary in order to constitute a
- 43


violation of that section that the child should be quick
or have arrived at that stage of development in its mother's
womb where it moved. But one who does the things which have
been prohibited in that section of the code for the pur-
poses of producing a miscaariage or abortion violates that
without regard to the age of the foetus in the mother's womb.
All that is necessary to be established is that there was a
foetus in the womb of some age and these acts were done for the
purpose of producing a miscarriage or abortion.
I, therefore, charge you that if one violates that
provision of the code, which I have just read, and commits the
unlawful act therein provided, and as a consequence of that un.
lawful act the death of the mother results, that that would con-
stitute the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the com-
mission of an unlawful act."
Said charge on the subject of involuntary manslaughter
in the commission of an unlawful act was error for the reason
that the allegations of the second count of the presentment show
that if any offense is alleged thereby, it is not the offense of
involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act,
but the offense set out and defined by Section 81 of the Penal
Code of Georgia of 1910, and puxnished as assault with intent
to murder. Although the second count of said presentment was
denominated involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an
unlawful act, the presentment showed that all the counts therein
were based on the seme identical facts, the same time, the same
persons, sameacts, and these facts showed that if any crime was
charged in said presentment it could only be the crime defined
by Sections 81 or 82 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910, and
regardless of the name which the pleader has given the various
counts in said presentment, the facts set out therein show what,
if any, offense is charged by said presentment, and that the same
did not charge, properly consttrued, the offense of involuntary
manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act, and there-
fore the charge of the Court on this subject was error and pre-
judicial to Movant.

follows, to-wit:
"The grand jury of this county have returned

the defendants are charged with three offenses in different parts

the grand jurors aforesaid, in the name and behalf of the citizens of
Georgia, do further charge and accuse the said W. Gl. Waters and M.T.
Suramerlin with the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the commissio
of an unlawful act, for that the said W. G. Waters and M. T. Summer-
lin, in the county and state aforesaid, on the 20th day of February,
in the year of our Lord, 1919, with force and arms and without any
intention to do so, but in the commission of an unlawful act, did
unlawfully, feloniously and willfully kill Viola Parr, the said
Viola Parr being at the time a pregnant woman, by then and there
using and employing an instrument and instruments to the grand jurors
unknown, which said instrument and instruments were by the said W.G.
Waters and M. T. Summerlin used and employed for the purpose and with
the intent thereby to produce the miscarriage and abortion of the
said Viola Parr, and by the use and employment of said instrument
and instruments on the person of thesaid Viola Parr did thereby cause
and produce the miscarriage and abortion of said Viola Parr and did
-

thereby kill the said Viola Parr, the use and employment of said
instrument and instruments not being then and there necessary to
preserve the life of the said Viola Parr and not having been ad-
vised by two physicians to be necessary for that purpose; said W.G.
Waters and M. T. Summerlin in the manner and form aforesaid the said
Viola Parr did unlawfully, feloniously and willfully kill, contrary
to the laws of said state, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.'
This was error because the Court inadvertently stated
more strongly and gave more emphasis by reiteration to the contentions
and charges of the State than to the contentions and defenses of the
defendant. The only defense suggested by the Court as claimed by
defendant, "that he is not guilty of any of the offenses charged in
the indictment and this plea makes the issues for you to determine"
but even this contention is not repeated afterwards when the Court
charged the contentions of the State, as contained in count one, nor
is it repeated after the Court charged the contentions of the State
as contained in count two. Thus, more emphasis was given to the con-
tentions of the State and these contentions were given all the solemnit
of the charges as made in the indictment.
It was error for the Court not to charge in this
comection some specific defense of the defendant to these specific
charges. The defendant did have a theory and a defense and it was
supported not only by his statement but by the evidence of the
State. The Court committed error in not charging the contentions and
defenses of the defendant, and harmful error, because the jury were
led to believe that in the absence of such a charge the Court believed
that the defendant had no defenses worth mentioning. The defenses
of the defendant, as shown by his statement and the evidence, were
as follows, to-wit:
$10 The first defense of Movent was that he had dilated
the womb of the deceased innocently and without any knowledge of her
pregnant condition and that he had not entered into the womb itself,
did not destroy or puncture the amniotic sac, did not cut away the
placenta and did not in any way come in contact with any foetus, but
that he performed a simple dilation of the uterus extending invafd
only about an inch or so. That the dilation as performed by him was


Page 29.
a legitimate one, well recognized in the medical profession and was
done for the sole purpose of relieving anticipated painful menstrua-
tion.
(2) That the second defense of Mouant was that even
though deceased, Viola Parr, at the time of said dilation carried
in the amniotic sac, e foetus, that said foetus was dead at the time
of the dilation and had been dead for some time, and that the defendant
could not be guilty under any count in the presentment for any act
which had the effect of expelling the dead foetus from the womb, and
that even though he had done so on purpose and with full knowledge,
it was legitimate and the proper thing to do from a medical point
of view,
(3) The third defense was that there was no mortal
wound given by the defendant to the deceased, as charged in the pre-
sentment and no wound of any kind proven by the evidence, but on the
contrary all the evidence for the State and the defendant's state-
ment shows that not only was no mortal wound inflicted by defendant
from which the said Viola Parr died, but not even the semblance of a
wound.
(4) The fourth defense of the defendant supported by the
evidence and the defendant's statement was that the dilation of the
cervix nor anything else done by defendant was the proximate cause of
the death of the deceased, nor even the indirect cause of her death,
and that it was incumbent on the State to show beyond a reasonable
doubt that what defendant did caused the death of Viola Parr.
(5) The fifth defense of defendant was that the evidence
going to establish the causes of the death of the deceased was entire-
ly circumstantial and could only be established by opinions, the
opinions of experts, and that the evidence on this question should not
only show the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, but
should exclude every other reasonable hypothesis except the guilty
of the accused. The defendant under this defense contending that the
evidence showed not only that he did nothing to produce death, but
that death must have been caused from infection and that this infec-
tion could have been set up in many ways outside of and independent


Page 30
of what this defendant did.
It was error for the Court not to charge on these con-
tentions of defendant and not to tell the Jury that the defendant re-
lied on these defenses, and that if they believed any one of them
to be true, that it would be their duty to acquit the defendant on
all three counts in the presentment. The Court should have stated
these contentions and defenses of the defendant to the Jury and
charged them as above set out for the reason that Counsel for de-
fendant strongly contended for them before the Jury and for the
reason that said defenses are not only supported by the defendant's
statement but also by the evidence of the State's witnesses. Said
evidence and the defendant's statement in support of these defenses
being in part as follows:
Dr. W. G. Waters, the defendant, stated on the stand
in part as follows:
"On the 20th day of February past about twelve o'clock,
I guess some where along about that time, I had a 'phone message from
Dr. Summerlin's office saying that he wanted to see me for a treat-
ment. I gave him an engagement and he came over in just a few minutes.
It might have been eleven o'clodk,- somewhere about the middle of the
day. I have been treating Dr. Sumerlin for lumbago occasionally for
several months, I don't know just how long. He came in and I gave him
an engagement and he came in and I got through with him. As he start-
ed out he told me that Miss Parr wanted to see me at his office and
he left. I said 'Will you tell her, if you are going back to the
office, I will be over there a little later, that I have to go out
on a call now and I will be over there about one,- some where between
one and one-thirty.! I went on my other call and got around about
that time. I couldn't say what time,- some time between one and one-
thirty. I went in his reception room and I rang the bell,- which is in
the right hand side of his reception room. He has four rooms; one of
them, two of them face College Avenue, and another one faces this way
and makes it an ell like this and his reception room is right here,
the X-Ray room here and another room of some kind here, and there is
an operation room around here. I went in the reception room, which
is right here. I rang the bell and Miss Parr respond ed and I said
'you wanted to see me, did you?' and she said 'yes'; and I said
"what is it'; she sat down there in the reception room. I didn't
see or hear anyone. She says to begin with in September or October,
some where back there, she had had flu and had been suffering with
her menstruation since that time. I says 'how'; she said very pain-
ful and it made her weak and made her nervous. I says 'when were you
sick last'; she says 'three or three and a half weeks ago',- some-
thing like that; I wouldn't be exact but three or three and a half
weeks. I says 'what about it'; she said 'I want you to do a dila-
tation of the uterus as I had this dilatation done about a month ago!.
That was the 20th day of February that I saw her. She said 'I had this
done about a month ago'; I wouldn't say exactly a month, but it might
have been twenty three days or it might have been twenty-eight. She
said about a month ago. She told me she was sick three weeks before
give you an enga cement at my Offic
later', - probably half an hour or some time I have forgotten wat,
and she ix say's 'no, I want it done here." She says 'Dr. Summerlin

has an operating table' as she had had it done before. She says 'I
had it done in Dr. Summerlin's office in the X-Ray room'. He has
an operating table there for the use of taking X-Rays, using an X-Ray i
in making pictures of fractures and so on. I said "I rather you come
to the officer and she said 'no', I want it done here' and she had an
operating table there. I said 'well, I will be back over here in a
little while, few minutes'. Another reason I said 'why not come on to
my office'; she said 'it may hurt me'. I said 'did it hurt you before';
she said 'no', she said it may hurt me though'; I said 'it is not
necessarily a painful operation, just a little dilatation'; she said
'if it does hurt me I want to be here where I can take as if it does
hurt me.' I said 'that is not necessary, -don't know of any pain about
it, however, I will come.' I went back to my office and I got a
uterine dilator and I came back within twenty or thirty minutes, I
don't remember how long from the time I left her office and walked
back to my office,- it was twenty or thirty minutes, - may have been
fifteen,- Idon't remember exactly how long. I came back and entered the
reception room and rang the bell. She came to the other door and I
said there is a uterine dilator, little instrument to dilate the
uterus,- you take it and sterilize it.' knowing that she sterilized,
knew how to sterilize. It was wrapped up in a towel; I said "put that
in a sterilizer and boil it.' I told her before I left to fix the
water because I have to sterilize the instrument; she did and when I
got back she said 'the water is boiling now in the electric sterilizer.3
I said 'why don't you get the doctor (to go back a little ) that did
this dilatation before, - why don't you get the doctor to do that';
she said 'I can't get him. I wanted to go back a little bit. That
was when I made my first visit to the office, - ' way don't you get the
doctor that did the dilation before' and she said she couldn't get
him. She took the instrument and went where she sterilized it in an
electric sterilizer she said and she went around that way, I don't
know which room. She said 'you to in there and dix the table, the
operating table, the way you want it.' I went in and found the table
and I spread a little cover over it and fixed the pillow and fixed the
table for the dilatation. She said 'how long do you want this to
boil'; I said 'five minutes at least' and I said 'be sure and immerge
it in the water thoroughly and when you come back bring this sterile
water with you'. She was in there five or six minutes and brought the
water back in a basin and I took a cyanide tablet which is a strong
antiseptic tablet and washed my hands with a brush and cleaned them
and made them as thoroughly clean as I could. I was in there to do
this dilatation about, I would say any where from eight to twelve or
fourteen minutes, - not fifteen minutes at the outside from the time
I started. I went on and got through and I left her and went back to
the office. Then it was, oh, two o'clock probably, somewhere about
that time,- micht have been two-thirty, I don't remember the exact.
time. I didn't see liss Parr any more. 'Never did see her after that
time. I was there,- I was in there about ten or fifteen minutes, -
might have been eight or ten minutes,- just a few minutes in alí.
I never did see her any more." - - -
"I heard of her death, as Dr. Holliday stated about the conversation
in his office Saturday evening. We talked about the case. I said
'Yes sir, I did the dilation, I had no idea in the world there was
any trouble with the girl, and so far as I knew she was as pure as a
snowdrift from Heaven.-No intimation of it,- I saw no signs of it, no
physical sions of it, None under the sun. - -
I also said to Charley Parr, 'I dilated the uterus, and I had no
idea in the world that the girl was in trouble. I saw no sions or
symptoms any way of it, and as far as I knew she was as pure as any
girl und er the sun, and what I did was absolutely innocent of any
wrong doing." - -
"I have a license, recognized by the State authorizing me to practice
my profession, osteopathy and its subjects, surgery and obstetrics. Fux
That license is recorded here with the Clerk of the Court." - -
"I want to reiterate to you one statement, that when that girl talked
