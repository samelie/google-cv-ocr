W.G.WATERS AND
M.T. SUMMERLIN.
Now comes W.G.Waters one of the defendants in the above
named and stated case, and before arraignment and before pleading
to the presentment therein, and demurs thereto, and for grounds of
demurrer, says:
1st. This defendant d murs to said presentment upon
the grounds that the allegations therein do not charge this de-
fendant with any of rense under the law, and under the allegations
therein the defendant is not guilty of any offense under the
laws of this State.
2nd. This defendant d murs to said presentment upon
the grounds that there is no offense under the laws of this
State charged against defendant therein, and the allegations of
said presentments do not set out and charge an offense under the
1 as of this state against defendant.
| 3rd. This defendant demurs to said presentment upon
the grounds that the allegations therein are not sufficient to
charge this defendant with a violation of any offense under the
1 aws of this state, and said presentment is wholly insufficient
in 1 w.
4th. This defendant especially demurs to the first
count of said presentment, wherein the State attempts to charge
the defendant with murder, upon the grounds to-wit:
(a) There is no language in said Count charging that
defendant used any weapon likely to produce death. If it had been
charged that such weapon was used, intention could be presumed, nor
is it charged that saia"instrument and instruments" were used
in a manner calculated to cause death.
(b) There is no charge in said count of the present-
ment containing the two (2)negatives set forth in Sections 81
and 82 of the Penal Code of Georgia, of 1910 in reference to
abortion; it not being stated that the abortion of the said Viola
Parr was not necessary to save her life, nor that it was done
12


without the advice of two (2)physicians. It was necessary to
charge in this count these two negatives, for the reason that all
three of the Counts described the one transaction, same time,
place, persons, and death, and counts two and three set out in
detail the facts, and these facts being such as to describe and
charge an abortion as contained in Section 81 of the Penal Code
of Georgia of 1910. That while Murder is formally charged in the
first counts all the facts alleged to make any crime are set
forth in the second and third counts.
(c) That the charges and allegations in said count of
the presentment are too vague and indefinite, and fail to put the
defendant upon notice as to what specific conduct he has been
guilty of; how and where any mortal wound was given. The only
language being, "Did kill and murder by then and there using and
employing a certain instrument and instruments to the Grand Jurors
unknown by inflicting in and on the person of saia Viola Parr
a Mortal wound". That said language is too vague and does not
sufficiently describe the manner in in which any instrument was
used, how any wound was inflicted, and where. That said language
dies not put the defendant on Notice of the details of the charge
and how ånd in what manner, and under what circumstances he could
have or did commit the offense of murder.
5th. The defendant especially demurs to the second
count of said presentment upon the following grounds, to-wit:
(a) That the allegations of the second count of said
presentment are insufficient in law to constitute a valid pre-
sentment for the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the Com-
mission of an unlawful act.
(b) Because the allegations of the second count of
said presentment shows that if any offense is alleged thereby,
it is not the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the Com-
mission of an unlawful act, but the offense punished as Assault
with intent to murder by Section 81 of the Penal Code of Geor-
gia of 1910.
(c) That the allegations made in the second count
charging involuntary manslaughter are too vague and indefini-
te, and do not put the defendant on Notice as to how the said
Viola Parr was killed. There is no allegation that any wound
18


was given, how any instrument s were used, whether in a deadly
manner or not, the only charge being that instruments were used
to create an abortion and not to kill. The charge being that an
abortion was produced, "and did thereby kill the said Viola Parr."
If killed by the instruments, it is not alleged definitely, and if
killed by the abortion, it is not alleged how the abortion killed,
and in what manner death was produced.
6th. The defendant especially demurs to the third
count upon the following grounds to-wot:
(a) That the defendant, contrary to law, ic charged in
the third count, under section 8.1 or 83 of the Penal Code of Geor-
gia of 1910,with abortion, said Count being for assault with in-
tent to murder, in the same presentment which charges him in se-
pa rete counts with murder and involuntary manslaughter. The Three
offenses charged, in the three seperate counts, being all based
upon the same identical facts, and the said three offenses not
belonging to a series, but being entirely seperate offenses, with
sepa rete punishments for each.
(b) That the third count based upon the same identical
facts, and said facts constituting under section 81 of the Penal
Code of Georgia of 1910, a specific offense,cannot be charged in
three separete counts as three sep arete offenses, but can only be
charged as one offense, and that offense the one designated by
statute, to-wit: Section 81 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910,
assault with intent to murder.
(c) That in the third count it is not alleged that
the child was a living child or was what is commonly known as
"Quick", and that under section 81 of the Penal Code of Georgia
of 1910 it is necessary to allege and prove that the child was
"quick" in order to constitute a felony as defined by said sec-
tion 81. That if said child was not a "quick" child the facts
set out in the third count would charge only a misdemeanor, as
contained in Section 82 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910.
(a) That the allegations as contained in the third
count are not sufficient to charge assault with intent to mur-
der, a felony, for the reason that it is not charged that the


the child alleged to have been destroyed was a"quick" chila
or that it was a living child and that, although said count
attempted to charge a felony, in fact it only charges a mi s-
dome anor, the misdemeanor charged being that described in sec-
tion 82 of the Penal Code of Georgia, 1910, That the Third count
therefore charging a misdemeanor is illegally joined with the
first and second counts of said presentment, each of which char-
ges a felony, and under the rule, it is not permissible in the
same presentment to join felonies and misdemeanors.
(e) That the entire presentment should be quashed
unless the State shall elect whether it will proceed under the
first two counts of said presentments or under the third count.
(f) That in the third count it is not charged or al-
leged that the child died, or was destroyed by the use of any
instrument, nor is it charged that the life of said child was
destroyed at all, this being a necessary allegation under sec-
tion 81 of the Penal Code of Georgia, of 1910.
WHEREFORE, defendant prays that each and all of the
foregoing grounds of demurrer be examined into by the Court,
and that the said presentment be quashed upon each and all
of said grounds, and that this defendant be not required to
plead further thereto.

THE STATE OF GEORGIA,
Respondent.
RIAL. FILED TUNE 21st
1919
Now comes the Movant in the above stated case, W. G. Waters,
on this the 21st day of June, 1919, the time and date set for the heer-
ing of this motion, and by leave of the Court first obtained, amends
his motion for a new trial heretofore filed by adding thereto the
following grounds, to-wit:
Because during the progress of the trial of said case,
and before the Solicitor-General had made his opening statement to
the Jury as to what were the State's contentions and as to what the
State expected to prove, Hovant requested that the witnesses be put
under the rule and sequestered, which request was not entertained by
the Court until after the Solicitor-General had made the opening state-
ment in the presence of the State's witnesses, and because the Solicitor
General was allowed to state to the Jury in the presence of the State's
witnesses what the State expected to prove by them. The Court, when re-
quested by Movant to sequester the witnesses ruled as follows: "I will
entertain that motion after the opening statement."
This ruling of the Court was error because in effect. It
deprived lovant of the results that he would be entitled to have under
Section 1043 of the Penal Code, that is, that he have the right to eze
amine the State's witnesses out of the hearing of each other and by
cross examination and from conflicts in the testimony resulting there-
from. The ruling of the Court in ellowing the Solicitor-General to re-
cite in their presence and in the presence of the Jury what he expected
to prove by each of them rendered sequestration afterwards practically
useless, and thus resulted in'serious injury to the accused and de-
prived Hovent of the benefits and rints riven to him under Section
20


1043 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910;
ià, of 1910, the mijens besis that the starter
Snotenie case reater coit these cortrésses, Ear Courieta washar
on thee festimony - -5..
Because the Court erred, after a request had been made by
Movant to sequester the witnesses, in allowing the witnesses, Mrs. G. D.
Parr, Charlie Parr and Frank Parr to remain in the Court room and to
hear the testimony introduced in said case and to testify after they
had heard a part of the testimony in the case. These witnesses never
at any time having been put under the rule as requested by lovant, but
were allowed by the Court, at the request of the Solicitor-General, to
remain in the Court room and to help in the prosecution of the case, aqaush
The request af mor aut -
The Guling of the Court in not enforcing the rule as to
these witnesses practically nullified Section 1043 of the Penal Code
of Georgia of 1910, and was error because it violated said section, and
said ruling resulted in great harm and injury to the accused from the
fact that it allowed the entire family of the person alleged to have
been killed to surround the Solicitor-General and to hear each other
testify and gave every opportunity to eliminate any conflicts among
these witnesses and deprived movant of the effectiveness of the cross-
examination, which was a substantive richt, aut from the fact thal
morawh was lenvicted on the testimony of these coétresses-
Because the Court refused to allow the witness, Sam Woods,
while on the stand, to answer the following question propounded to him
by Movant, to-wit: Question: "Dr. Waters did come back?", Movant in-
sisting and so stating to the Court then and there that he expected
to prove by this witness that as soon as the indictment was found and
the Court House was open, that Dr. Waters came right back for trial
and surrendered himself to the Sheriff and that he only went away on
account of advice and threats of violence, and that the witness, if
permitted to answer, would answer as above set forth.
The Court refused to allow said testimony to be given to
the Jury and ruled out the question: "And he did come back?"
This was error for the reason that the Court had already per-
mitted evidence to go to the Jury on the question of the alleged flight
of mo vant, said testimony having been given by the witness Frank Parr,
21


and being as follows:
"After that time Dr. Waters left town. I don't know the
exact time he remained away from here".
Also testimony having already been given by the witness,
Sam Woods, and being as follows:
"I took him (Dr. W. G. Waters) out of town to Winder to
catch a train. It was about four o'clock in the morning--that was be-
fore day at that time."
Movant should have been allowed to explain by testimony
why he left Athens and that he did not leave on account of conscious
guilt as the State attempted to show, but that he left to avoid violence
and that he voluntarily returned and surrendered himself to the Sheriff
when the Presentment was returned by the Grand Jury.
This was harmful error in view of the charge of the Court
on the subject of flight hereinafter set out in this motion.
Because the verdict of the Jury in the case of the State vs.
M. T. Summerlin, who was jointly indicted with Movant, was allowed to
be carried out by the Jury trying Novant and kept by said Jury while
considering Movant's case. The verdict of the Jury in the said case of
The State vs. M. T. Summerlin was as follows:
"1. We, the Jury, find the defendant, M. T. Summerlin,
not guilty of the offense of murder- as under the 1st count.
2. We, the Jury, find the defendant - M. T. Summerlin -
guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of
an unlawful act - as under the second count.
3. We, the jury, find the defendant - M. T. Summerlin
not guilty of assault with intent to murder as under the
third count.
May 16th, 1919. R. T. Goodwin, Sr.,
Foreman."
Said verdict was not written on the presentment, but was
written on a separate sheet of paper which was pinned to said present-
ment. On the trial of Movant, said verdict was detached by Counsel for
movant and delivered to the Clerk of said Court, and just before the
charge of the Court, the Solicitor-General asked counsel for movant,
in open Court, if they wanted the verdict in the case of The State vs.
1. T. Summerlin to go out with the Jury with the presentment. Counsel
22


for Movant then and there and in open Court objected, to said verdict
being sent out with the Jury, but in some manner, unknown to Movant
or his Counsel, said verdict did go out with said Jury, and this with-
out the knowledge or consent and over the objection in open Court
of Movant.
That the verdict of the Jury finding guilty, M. T. Sum-
merlin, who was a joint defendant in said presentment with movent, was
allowed to go out with the Jury trying movant was error and highly pre-
judicial to movant, for the reason that said verdict had no bearing on
the guilt or innocence of Novant, and that the same was highly pre-
judicial to Movant is shown by the fact that the Jury trying Movant
made a faithful copy of said verdict, even to the unnecessary details
of copying the following letters and figures at the heading of same:
"Ent. 45-585", the same being the notation that the Clerk of the Court
had made on the verdict in said Summerlin case showing that said ver-
dict had been entered in Minute Book 45 on page 585. The verdict ren-
dered in Movant's case being an exact copy as to each count, of the
verdict in the case of the State vs. Summerlin, with the exception of
the necessary changes in names of defendant,foreman of jury andddates
of rendition. The verdict rendered in Novant's case being as follows:
"Ent 45 - 585
1. We, the Jury, find the defendant, W. G. Waters not
guilty of the offense of murder - as under the lst count.
2. We, the jury, find the defendant, W. G. Waters, cuilty
of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful
act - as under the second count.
3. We, the jury, find the defendant, W. G. Waters, not
guilty of assault with intent to murder as under the third
count.
May 21st, 1919.
IN N. Butler,
Foreman.
Because the Court failed to charge the Jury on the subject
of the good character of Iovant, Dr. W. G. Waters, and failed to charge
the Jury that good character, when proven, is a substantive fact, like
any other fact, tending to establish innocence and that good character
may be relied upon as a defense in a criminal case like any other de-
23


fense, and that such good character, if established, may generate in
the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
It was error for the Court not to charge upon this defense
of good character, even though there was no written request, for the ima
reason that Movant put in evidence his character, not only as a man,
but also put in evidence his professional character as a physician and
he relied upon this as a distinct substantive defense.
It was also error for the Court not to charge upon good
character for the reason that the case upon trial as shown by the
evidence and the statement of the accused was an exceptional case."
The ascused in making his statement relied upon his unblen-
ished character as a man and as a physician as one of his defenses and
in this particular case, the strongest defense that he could make.
The charge against Movant was that he had induced an abortion
by a dilatation of the cervix of the uterus. The testimony of the
physicians for the State showed that there had been a dilatation of
the cervix and that there was no physical evidence of any violence to
the uterus, no puncture of the amniotic sac, but only the usual and
ordinary evidence that might be found in any legitimate case of dila-
tation and that such dilatations were very common and recognized as
proper in the profession. Such dilatations however, in cases of preg-
nancy and especially where pregnancy was not known to the physician,
often induced abortion.
The sole question therefore for the Jury to determine was
the good faith of Novant, Dr. Waters, Did he dilate the uterus inno-
cently and for a legitimate purpose, or did he dilate it criminally
and to produce an abortion? On this issue there were no witnesses to
testify, and Hovant, Dr. Waters, alone made a statement. There was no driesh
evidence that could be obtained by him in this peculiar situation, and
not allowed under the law to testify, he could only make his bare
· statement, and it was of tremendous importance to him that his character
as a man and as a physician should be considered by the Jury in de-
termining the question as to whether he had acted innocently and in
good faith or whether he had acted with full knowledge of the preg-
nancy and with criminal intent to produce an abortion.
24


In putting his character in evidence and in setting up this.
as one of his defenses, Ilovant, Dr. V. G. Waters, made the following
statements to the Jury on the trial of said case:
My father had 'six boys and one girl,- the youngest boy is
twenty nine years old. This is the first time in the history of this
family that there was ever a man before any Court,- never was one ar-
rested ,- never ones name mentioned in the Grand Jury ,- never one of
them drunk and before any Court of any kind or description. - - -
I have practiced my profession here since that time which
is about since 1905. I have tried to live right, tried to treat my
fellow man right, and I have tried to tell a man the truth, I go along
and try to attend to my own affairs. Never been before the Court be-
fore except probably as a witness in a case; as far as my having a
case, I never had a case in this Court before or in Judge West's Court.
I have been practicing my profession continuously since, except probably
a month some sumers, because two or three summers, I would go away
for a month or so,- continuously here in this City. - - -
I said (Speaking to Charlie Parr, brother of deceased) "I
haveheard about this case, Charlie, and I want to explain the matter
to you a little bit." I said "I told Dr. Holliday in his office the
previous Saturday that I wanted to see you and tell you about it,-
I wanted to tell you the part I played in it and I wanted to tell you
exactly what I did." I said "Charlie, I dilated that uterus and I had
no more idea in the world that that girl was in trouble, that there
was any trouble with her. I saw no signs or symptoms any way of it,
and as far as I knew she was as pure as any girl under the sun, and
in what I did, I was absolutely innocent of any wrong doing." -- -
Now Gentlemen, briefly, I know you all are tired of this,
that is what I know regarding this case, But I want to reiterate to
you one statement, that when that girl talked to me and in our con-
versation and in my actions with her, so far as I knew that there was
any wrong doing of that girl, she was as pure as a snow drift from
Heaven."
The defense contained in this statement was a good de-
fense in law and it was a doubly good defense when backed up by a man
of good character, and the Court erred in failing to charge on, or to
even mention either one of these defenses.
-9-
Because the Court erred in refusing to give in charge the
following requests to charge, the same heving been submitted in writing
Wesore the beginning of the chane aur
before the jury Getired to consider their verdict, the charge requested
being as follows:-
"If you believe from the evidence that Viola Parr was preg-
nant with a child and that the defendant, W. G. Waters, performed an
operation on her, without any knowledge on his part that she was preg-
nant and without any intention on his part to produce an abortion,
then you would be authorized under the law, and it would be your duty
to return a verdict of not guilty as to all three counts in this case."
It was error for the Court to refuse to give this Charge, be
cause there was abundant evidence to justify this charge. This was the
main defense of movant as contained in his statement and this defense
wes supported by other evidence in the case and was especially sup-
25

two of the witnesses for the State, auf defenfants Statement all

Because the Court erred in refusing to charge the following
request to charge, the same having been submitted in writing before !
aur before the court began to change the per
the Jury retired to consider their verdict, the charge requested blin's
as follows:
"I further charge you that if you believe from tthe evidence
that the defendant, W. G. Waters, performed an operation on Viola Parr,
and if you further believe from the evidence that at the time of the
operation she was pregnant, but that the child with which she was presa
nant was already dead, then it would also be your duty to return a
verdict of not guilty, because it would not be an abortion to pro-
duce or bring about the expulsion from the mother of a dead foetus
or child."
It was error for the Court to refuse to give this charge
because there was evidence by the State's witnesses, Drs. A. C. and
J. C. Holliday, from which the Jury would have been authorized to find
that the foetus with which the deceased was alleged to have been prec-
nant was already dead and had been deed for some time before Movant
performed the dilatation on deceased. If the foetus was dead, it could
be no crime to bring about its expulsion from the mother, regardless
of whether or not Movant knew of her condition of pregnancy or not,
and this being one of the theories of the defense, movant was entitled
to have the same submitted by appropriate instructions to the Jury.
In proof of the theory that the foetus was dead at the time
of the dilatation by Movant, there was the following testimony, Dr.
J. C. Holliday testified:
"I was called to the home of lrs. Parr. It was on the night
of Feby. 21st. I was called there to see Miss Viola. I found her in
very much pain in the lower part of her abdomen and she had a very high
temperature - 103."
This wasoonly about 24 to 30 hours from the time of the
dilation by movant, Dr. Waters.
The testimony of Dr. A. C. Holliday was as follows:
"If for any reason the foetus at an early age ceases to
develop further and is no longer growing with life, but ceases to grow
no more cells are added, it is possible that that foetus can sometimes
be carried in the womb for a great length of time with the bac not
ruptured in any way. Dr. Barton Cook Hirst is an authority and he re-
lates such a case in medical history. So that if the body of the womb
contracts it would keep that foetus in amore or less preserved con-
dition so that sometimes as the authorities say it preserves its rosy
26

appearance when opened. It could be carried there for several weeks,
several months. The amniotic fluid is, sterile and this foetus floats in
that fluid during the whole time of gestation. If a womb should be
dilated, that is the cervix dilated and air gets in there, oxygen, it
would immediately set up a decomposition, and it should be expelled
right away. If it didn't you would have some decomposition; you would
have odors very rapidly, but possibly not until the decomposition had
set in, and after the infection you would have very high fevers and a
corresponding pulse. You would not have your temperature until you get
the infection. In other words the temperature is like a red danger
flag that sets up and shows infection in these cases. If the temperature
goes to 100 degrees and especially to 101, abi physicians would think
that very dangerous' If it ran up to 103 degrees, still more dangerous.
If a young woman had been carried home on Thursday night
nearly dark and on the next Friday night she was found to be in the corre
dition described - 103 degrees of fever, and if there had been a di-
lation and opening up of the womb just the day before and if there had
been in that womb a foetus that had not been living for some time; it
would be an indication that septaca emia had set up because of the pre-
vious conditions behind Thursday afternoon. In that instance, we have
got to have the point of infection, insisted foetus, that is a foetus
floating in the amniotie fluid in the sac inside of the uterus, can
be dead and possibly tbt if the placenta, where it is attached to the
womb is torn some, then you get your infection which would set up
very quickly a virulent infection. But the rule is those infections
usually come in from three to four days.
If a certain condition existed, for instance, if there had
been a dilation of the womb and you had any reason to expect infection
from that particular thing, you would expect usually that septaca emia
would set up about three or four days afterwards. It is my opinion
that when it sets up within twenty four hours that you would be put on
notice and suspicion that it might date behind the dilation on Thursday.
In other words, the general rule is that in all of these puerperal
infections, it follows in three or four days. I have never seen a case
where it came und er three days.
If there is a dilation, it would sometimes set up labor,
because the placenta in those cases after the foetus is dead very
often crows on and where there is a dilation there is a disposition
set up to contract and expel this placenta, because MEXXXXXX of
the placenta coming to time. When you produce that dilation there, and
when that is over with the womb would contract and the contraction of
the womb, the clamping down of the womb on the placenta causes the
placenta to become detached from the uterine wall and therefore you
get an expulsion of it. -
When it becomes detached there you have a blood flow, a
hemorrhage to that placental site. - -
When you begin to contract and expel the placenta by the
action of contracting the uterus, it is such as to separate the pla-
centa into threads and to expel it."
Und er this evidence and this defense of Movant, it was error
for the Court to refuse to charge the Jury as requested. Especially
since the evidence of the State itself abundantly showed that not only
did all the phenomena indicate a dead foetus in the womb, but that the
foetus was in all probability killed either by the use of tablets,
electricity, morphine and especially by contact with the rays of the
X-ray machine, at which deceased worked, and so other Theing, or qpla-

Because the Court erred in charging the jury as follows,
27


Page 9.
to-wit: "Our Gode provides, dying declarations made by any person in
the article of death, who is conscious of his condition, as to the cause
of his death, and the person who killed him, are admissible in evidence
in a prosecution for the homicide,
Great caution is necessary in the admision and use of this kind
of testimony, It is not necessary that the person whose statements are
sought to be introduced should express himself or herself as believing
that he or she is in a dying condition. Consciousness of the condition
of the person who is alleged to have made the statements may be inferred
from the nature of the wound or from other circumstances. Dying decla-
rations, when the jury is satisfied that they are such, are found ed on
the necessity of the case and the reason being that being made in view
of impending death and jud ment, when the hope of life is extinct and
when the retributions of eternity are at hand, they stand on the same
plane of solemnity as statements made under oath."
The errors in this charge being as follows, to-wit:
As to the caution and the rule of application of this kind of
testimony, the Court charged in one abstract sentence, "great caution
is necessary in the admission and the use of this kind of testimony."
This charge was of no practical benefit to the jury and no protection to
the defendant. The Court should have stated that was meant by "caution"
and should have given the jury some for the application of the rule
to the facts in this particular case. The Court should have charged and
the evidence authorized such an instruction, that they should consider
whether the declarant's account of the occasion was influenced by re-
sentment and therefore was biased and incomplete." And in determining
its protative value he should have given the circumstances under which
such testimony could be considered, what the physical condition of the
declarant would be as to influencing these declarations, and all the
attendant circumstances which were calculated to impa ir her powers of
observation or memory. He should have also given the rule that the
jury might consider the bias or prejudice of the witness relating to
the jury these alleged dying declarations, and should have also
28


Page 10.
instructed the jury that they should consider what the mental condition
of this witness, Mrs. Parr, who detailed to the jury the alleged dying
declarations, whether she was calm enough to remember accurately the
declarations, whether or not she was excited, and that such declarations
being admitted might or might not be forgotten or colored or misunder-
. stood or changed by any infirmities of the person relating them.
b.
The batter part of said charge was also error for the following
reasons, to-wit: the said part of the charge being as follows: "Dying
declarations, when the jury is satisfied that they are such, are founded
on the necessity of the case and the reason being that being made in view
of impending death and judgment, when the hope of life is extinct and
when the retributions of eternity are at band, they stand on the same
plane of solemnity as statements made under oath."
The error in this particular part of the charge being that
the Court gave grea ter emphasis to this evidence than it was entitled to
have and more than was given to other evidence in the case. The jury
were impressed by this charge that the alleged dying declarations were
of great weight and stood upon a higher plane than ordinary testimony,
being made when hope of life was_extinct, and when the retributions of
eternity vere at hand. The Court should have stated the simple rule
that such dying declarations stood upon the same plane as the statements
made under oath. This part of the charge was also error because the
Court erred in instructing the jury that dying declarations were founded
on the necessity of the case and "the reason being that being in view
of impending death and judgment". The simple rule should have been
stated, if any rule at all was stated, that dying declarations were
admitted on account of the necessity of the case because there were no
eye witnesses, this being the rule at common law and being only ad-
missible under the common law when there was no eye pitness, and later
extended under our statute, even when another witness was present. But
the reason for their admission is not that it is "made in view of
impending death and jud ement." This was ran the reason per
