Gentlemen:-
It was my purpose to be present in person at the hearing of the case of Dr. Maxis
T. Summerlin; but circumstances here have made that impossible, and y am begging your in-
dulgence for a few minutes through this note.
It is my earnest conviction that the Prison Commission of the state of Georgia could
not do a more just, merciful and humane act than that of recommending the full pardon of
Dr.Maxie T. Summerling; and this T base upon the following reasons,
1. His trial was largely influenced by the prejudices of the moment; and it is my
conviction that if he was tried to-day with the same evidence, that he would never be found
guilty.
2. I am convinced in my own mind that he was convicted of a crime that he was
not guilty of; and there were extenuating circumstances in any lack of morality that he show
3. He was given the full limit of the law in his sentence, even though he was
confined without bond in the County Fail for months before his trial.
4. Something should be credited to him for his good citizenship, for my per-
sonal investigation, made among those who have known him from boyhood, resulted in the
knowledge that he hag always lived an exemplary life; and that he is clean and clear-cut
in the morals of his life preceding this ifortunate affair.
5. His personal mortification and humiliation have reached the limit of
their possibility, and cannot be increased; and hence his real punishment has been super-
lative in degree.
6. Innocent collaterals, in the form of his wife and child and aged father, are
the sufferers now, for his accumulated finances have been dissipated and his home wrecked
by the stern hand of the law; and his wife,recently undergoing a serious operation, is
needing his presence with her in her nervous state; and his young child is just reaching
that age now where its memory will sour and ambitter its future.
7. Public sentiment has unquestionably changed and is demanding the release
of this man from the firm grip of the law.
Gentlemen of the Prison Commission, I feel so much the need of Divine mercy that it
has long since been the fixed policy of my life, that even if stern justice is on the
one side(though I an unwilling to admit that in this case) and tearful mercy on the
other, and the slightest doubt is on my mind, to cast my vote on mercy, 8 side. "The mercy,
to others show, oh, cod, that mercy show to me! #
Most faithfully yours,
GAT)

Dear Sir:
Yours of May 30th received.
In your letter of April 9th advising that
there was an application for executive clemency in
the case of M.T. Summerlin convicted of involuntary man-
slaughter in Clarke Superior Court, you asked neither for
opinion or recommendation. I, therefore, volunteered
none.
In your letter OI May 30th, you ask for my views
in rolerence to the application.
My views in reference to the ease fully appear
in the remarks I made at the time of passing sentence.
They are I file in the Clerk's Office. I have no doubt
Judge Fortson would have the Clerk to send them to you
if you requesteà.
As at present advised, I see no sufficient
reason for clemency, and, therefore, cannot recommend
same.
Yours very respectfully,
Auckey! both

have done and 10 one blames them for taking the stand they did in
this matter.
The prisoner 120w comes before you and asks that he be given
a chance to show to the world what is in him, that he, it allowed
to go back into the business world, can and will make a good and
useful citizen. He has suffered only as a pan of refinerent and
cultur, can suffer; and like the gold with the dross burned away,
when he again takes his place in society and the business world
his suffering, if possible, will have made him mor, charitabl.
and syrpathetic, a better citizen.
He asks to be given this chance, he asks to be restored to
his wife and child. Will you need his request?
It is my sincere belief that you will never have cause to
regret your action in rcommending to His Excellency a pardon.
Trusting that you gentlement will see your way cier to act
favorably in Dr, Summerlin's behalf.
I am yours

Atlanta, Georgia,
Gentlemen:
I understand that Dr. M. T. Sumerlin has applied
to you for a recommendation for a pardon, or parole, and I am
writing in his behalt.
A jury has found him guilty, sentence has been pro-
nounced and he is now serving that sentence of three years.
Dr. Sumerlin is a man of fine instincts and the
imrisonment of himself in a cell, thm trial and conviction
and publicity given to this unfortunate case has been greater
punisment than any labor that can be inflicted upon him.
In some cases the pangs of disgrace and humiliation
are a punishment, while in other cases the hard labor is the only
thing that the prisoner worries about; Dr. Surmerlin is in the
former class,
Dr. Surmerlin is a man of strong personality, he has a
big heart and a sympathetic natur; it
g not his nature to hurt
anyone but rather to help and cheer the unfortunate,
In this particular case the accused has suffered much,
but, he is not the only one who suffers -his devoted wife and
young son are sharing in his suffering, even moreso, perhaps, than
the husband and father,

I write to ask a favorable consideration of the appli-
cation for pardon now pending before your body in behalf of Dr. l.
T. Sumørlin, who was convicted in the Superior Court of Clarke
County for involuntary manslaughter and sentenced for the term of
three years and who is now serving said sentence in the penitentiary.
I was present in court when this case was tried and the
evidence on which he was convicted was, to my mind, very weak.
I will further state that the sentiront of a large per
cent. of our best citizens is in syrapathy with him and believe he
is not guilty of the crime for which he was convicted.
Dr. Sumarlin has always, prior to his trial, borne a
good character and regarded as one of our best citizens.
Yours very truly,

Gentlemen:
I understand that an application for pardon
of Dr. M. T. Surme rlin will be heard by your honorable
body next Monday.
Dr. Summerlin, up to the time of the trouble
for which he was tried, bore an enviable reputation in
this comimnity. He was regarded as one of the leading
citizens.
The re exists in the minds of a great many people
the impression that Dr. Summerlin had to bear more than
his share of the responsibility of the unfortunate occurr-
ence.
Dr. Summerlin was the sole support of a wife and
one child.
For these reasons I believe you would be justified
in commuting his sentence at the present time.
Yours very truly,

It is my candid opinion that had any other judge presided
(and displayed no feeling) Dr. Summerlin would have been acquitted.
His conviction was under form of law, but it is generally
conceded now that it was unwarranted.
In my judgment his full pardon would meet with the approv-
al of the great majority of the people in this county.
He has been done a great wrong and it should be righted,
as far as possible, without delay.
Sincerely yours,

Governor Thos. W. Hardwick,
Atlanta, Georgia.
Dear Governor:
I am writing you in behalf of Dr. Maxie T. Summerlin,
convicted and sentenced in Clarke Superior Court of a felony.
I learn that he is applying for a pardon, and from my
knowledge of the facts and circumstances, he deserves a full pardon.
It is the general concensus of opinion here in Athens,
that if Dr. Summerlin was tried tomorrow he would be quickly acquitted.
Dr. Summerlin was convicted alone on prejudice, in the
opinion of many, and a misguided and wrought up public sentiment.
As editor of the Athens Herald at that time, I was aware
of the fact that there was a regular system of propaganda issued agains
him, and many relatives and others interested in the prosecution
poisoned the air with suspicion.
Dr. Sunmerlin did not seem conscious of this deadly work
until the trial was on. His life was threatened, and it was feared if
he spoke all the truth, even on the stand, he would be shot by these
relatives. Besides he sought in every way not to reflect on the young
lady in the case.
There never was a chance for Dr. Summerlin at the trial.
It was impossible for him to get justice or have a fair and impartial
trial.
The trial judge - a most estimable gentleman - at this
trial was "beside himself". He lost his equilibrium, lost his head,
and the entire complexion of the court was hostile and vindictive to
the defendant.
A reading of the sentence pronounced by the trial judge,
a reprint of which from the "Herala" I have before me at this writing,
will convince anyone that he was not able to preside impartially. He
broke loose in a torrent of abuse and denunciation, saying that the
Legislature could not bribe his tongue, etc.
