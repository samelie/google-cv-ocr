Gentlemen:
Referring to application of Dr. M. T. Summerlin
of Athens for pardon. I understand that you will hear this
case on Thursday next, and I want to add my endorsement to
the application for the pardon of this young man, and I
hope that you may see fit to grant a full pardon after you
have heard the case, as it seems to me that the ends of
justice have been fully met.
Dr. Summerlin's brother, who is one of the leading
physicians of this County, and one of the finest citizens
of the State, will appear before you at the hearing on Thurs-
day. In his behalf, as well as behalf of his brother, this
request is made.
I expect to be in Atlanta in the next few days,
and would like to get an opportunity to say a few words in
person in behalf of Dr. Summerlin, in the event the case is
not decided favorably on Thursday.
With high regard, I am

Gentlemen :-
Having learned that an application will be presented
to you, asking for pardon or parole for Dr. M.T. Summerlin, who is
now serving a sentence of three years, imposed in Clarke County
Superior Court, I desire to write you in his behalf.
I have known Dr. Summerlin intimately for the past
ten years and previous to the time of his trouble I can safely
state to you that there has never been the slightest shadow
upon his character.
Dr. Summerlin has always borne the highest respect
and friendship of the business and social life of our City
and while I know, that the jury by its verdict has said that
this gentlemen is guilty, I also believe that from my own feelings
a gentlemen of Dr. Summerlin's type has suffered punishment
already that can not be measured in terms of imprisonment.
I further believe that should you see your way clear
to grant his petition that it will meet with the approval of
the general public and you will return to us a good and loyal
citizen as well as a kind and loving father and husband.
Trusting that you may see your way clear to grant
this request and thanking you for your indulgence in reading
this plea, I am,
Very truly yours,
Tatat


P.C. of Ga,
Dr. Sumnerlir before his trouble was a good citizen, standing
nigh in the business and social world and I believe if you gentlemen
will grant his petition that it will meet with the approval of the
general public and you will have no cause to regret your tiction in the
mattar.
Trouting tinat you may see your way clear to grant this
regrett, I am with sentiments of high esteen.
Yours very truly,

Atlanta, Georgia,
Gentlemen:
Having urrcre rstood that an application will be presented
to you, asking for a pardon, or parole, for Dr. II. 1. Surme riin, 720
is now serving a sentence of three mark, imposed in Clarke
Superior Court, I write you in his behalf.
I haya baan intimately associated with Dr. Summerlin, both
in a business way and socially for several years, I found him at all
times hightoned and honorable in his business dealings,
As a friend he is loyal and sincere and a man, I might add,
who numbers his friends by his acquaintances.
Being closely associated with him I had the opportunity of
always
knowing of his good qualities; he was ready to help the poor and
needy and unfortunate and did it in such a manner that few knew of
his many acts of charity.
(GAR
Wile, I know, the jury by its verdict has said this gent1.com
man is guilty, still, taking everything into consideration I believe
the Doctor has been punished sufficiently. A man of his standing and
femings suffers more from the publicity and mortification attendant
upon the case, more than imprisoment and labor.

Dear Judge Patterson:--
I am writing you in the interest of Dr. Mazie
T. Summerlin, who is now serving a sentence, and as I understand
it has filed a petition for pardon, which will probably be heart
tomorrow, or at least in the near future. I am not personally ac-
quainted with Dr. Summerlin, but am very reliably informed that
he is a member of a very reputable and influencial family, and I
an personally acquainted with his uncle Mr. S.F.Overstreet, of this
City, who is a personal friend of mine, and is an honorable, upright
centleman and a man who stards well in this community. From all
the information I can gather, I am convinced that Dr. Summerlin
is a victim of circumstances rather than a criminal. I feel from
the investigation I have made and from the information I have ob-
tained, that Dr. Summerlin was and is not gulity of the crime with a
which he was charged and of which he was convicted; therefore because
of the facts as above related, and because of the high esteem in
which I hold my good friend Ir. Overstreet, allow me to ask that
you use your influence and best efforts to secure a pardon for this
young man. Anything you may do will not only be a great favor
to the young man and to his uncle, Mr. Overstreet, but will be con-
sidered a personal favor to myself.
I wish to assure you that if I can ever be of service
to you in South Georgia you have only to command me and it will be
my pleasure to serve you.
with kind personal regards, I am,
Yours very truly,

Dear Judge Patterson:--
I am writing you in the interest of Dr. M. T.
Summerlin, who as I understand it has a petition before the Prison Come
mission asking for pardon. I wish to say that I am not personally
acquainted with Dr. Summerlin but am acquainted with his Father and
know him to be an honorable, upright, fine old gentleman; I am also
acquainted with his family connection senerally through this section
and know them to be very fine people and very influencial. I of course
know nothing of the record of the trial in this young man's case, but
from what I can gather am enclined to think that he is serving a sentence
for a crime of which he is not guilty.
I wish to ask that after investigation, should you see
your way clear indoing so, that you use your influence and efforts in

To Whom it may concern;
I am prompted to write the following to try and correct a
mistake, and at the same time give back to the public the talent that it is
entitled to.
Dr. Max Summerlin, whom I have known for some time, and now
located at the Confederate Soldiers Home as a prisoner, is a gentleman of the
highest type and in his profession stands at the top with the very best.
I have visited the Home a number of times since he has been
there and it has been a source of great pleasure to talk with him, being the
man he is; and the one thought that always stays with me is:that it is a
shame to rob the public of such a man.
If he had been guilty of what he was charged with, the
end of justice has been more than met.

"EVERYTHING IN DENTAL SUPPLIES"


Athens, Georgia, April 30, 1921.
TO His Excellency Hugh M. Dorsey,
Governor of the State of Georgia
and
The Honorable Prison Commission of
the State of Georgia,
Atlanta, Georgia.
Dear Sirs:
I have been advised of the application for executive
clemency that has been or will be, filed on behalf of Dr. li. T.
Summerlin.
I have known Dr. Summerlin ever since he has been
living in Athens, Georgia, he is one of our most highly
respected and esteemed citizens; his character was above re-
proach and he merited the confidence of our entire community
and City. He was recognized as an honest, truthful and law
abiding citizen. In addition to this he had the reputation
of being one of the best dentist in northeast Georgia.
On account of my personal acquaintance with Dr.
Summerlin and knowing his record I wish to state that I would
believe any statement that he would make. I have never
reached the conclusion that he should have been sent to the
penitentiary or convicted of the offense with which he was
charged, and I can further state that the greater majority,
if not almost seventy-five to eighty per cent or more of our
citizens feel the same way, and I wish to request the Prison
Commission and the Governor of Georgia to grant him a full
and complete pardon, as I am satisfied he has received more
punishment than he ever deserved.
Respectfully,
de Lite

tion he bore in the community where he resided, and deponent says

offence of which he was convicted in Clarke superior court.

sidered upright and honest in his dealings.
This affidavit is made to be used on the hearing of
