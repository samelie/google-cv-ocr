the allegations of those two counts, and in addition
that where the gravaman of the offense is abortion, that
the declaration of the woman who died as a result of it,
is not competent evidence,., ( The court Wexdixogx held that
said dying declaration was admissible as to the second
count and permitted said evidence of said, aying declara-
tion to go to the jury and be considered by the jury
as to count No.2 of said presentment, and excluded
said evidence as to said dying declaration as to count
N0.3), which objections the court then and there overruled.
Movant then and there excepted to said ruling
alleged
of the court in permitting said evidence of the dying
declaration to be considered by the jury under the
second count of said presentment and here and now
excepts and assigns the same as error, for that counts
two and three of said presentment charged and accused
defendant of a crime in which the gravaman of the offense
is abortion; and where the gravaman of the offense is
abortion the declaration of the woman who died as a result
of the abortion is not competent nor admissible evidence
of the commission of said abortion nor of the persons
who produced it; and where the offense charged is not
for the homicide of the declarant but for the XDA
offense of producing an abortion upon her as embodied
and defined in $81 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910
an assault with intent to murder and punished as assault
with intent to murder in case the death of child or
mother be thereby produced, the declaration of the woman
upon whom the abortion was produced, and who afterwards
died as a result therefrom is not competent nor admissible
in evidence against the accused.

Because the following material evidence was
illegally admitted to the jury by the court over the
objections of movant as applying to the second count of
said presentment, to-wit: The testimony of Dr. A. C.
witness for the State
Holliday, as to the dying declaration of Miss Viola Parr,
which was as follows:
"A. She said Dr. Summerlin was responsible
for her condition and Dr. Waters had produced the
abortion on her. I asked then if she had had a mis-
carriage an dshe said she had and I asked her how,--
Q. Where did she say the miscarriage or abortion was
produced? A. She said in Dr. Summerlin's office,
2. Did she go into any details in any way? A. Yes, I
a sked her, - I says "how did he do it"; she said Dr.
"aters had produced the abortion and I said "how did he do
it"; she said "he opened my womb" or "dilated my womb", -
I don't remember which she said, one or the other; I
think she said "he dilated my womb" I says to ber did
he hurt you" and she said "not much".
Q. Dr. Holliday-- ? A. I also asked her "where was Dr.
Summerlin" and she said "he was in and around about there."
Movant then and there objected to the
alle ged
admission of saiddying declaration and said evidence
at the time same was offered and did then and there
urge the following grounds of objections thereto, to-wit:
alleged
Objected to the admissibility of the , dying
declaration as it would relate to counts two and three
in the presentment and moved to exclude the consideration
of it by the jury in connection with the consideration
of either count No.2 or count No.3 upon the ground that
it is not admissible or competent testimony in view of
the allegations of those two counts, and in addition
that where the gravaman of the offense is abortion, that
the declaration of the woman who died as a result of it,
is not competent evidence. The court haxing held that
alleged
said dying declaration was admissible as to the second
alleged
count and permitted said efidence of said dying declara-
tionto go to the jury and be considered by the jury
Â·
28


#9.
as to count No. 2 of said presentment, and excluded
said evidence as to saidi dying declaration as to count
No.3, which objections the court then and there over-
ruled.
Movant then and there excepted to said ruling
alleged
of the court in permitting said evidence of the dying
declaration to be considered by the jury under the
second count of said presentment and here and now
excepts and assigns the same as error, for that counts
two and three of said presentment charged and accused
defendant of a crime in which the gravaman of the offense
is abortion; and where the graveman of the offense is
abortion the declaration of the woman who died as a result
of the abortion is not competent nor admissible evidence
of the commission of said abortion nor of the person
vino produced it; and where the offense charged is not
for the homicide of the declarant but for the offense
of producing an abortion upon her as embodied and defined
in 881 of the Penal Code of Georgia of 1910 as assault

intent to murder in case the death of child or mofther.
be thereby produced, the declaration of the woman upon
whom the abortion was produced, and who afterwards died
as a result therefrom is not competent nort admissible in
evidence against the accused.
--
Because the court committed error in refusing
to give in charge the following request to charge as
relating to the second count of said presentment, same
having been submitted in writing to the judge before he
commenced his charge to the jury in said case and before
29


#10.
the jury retired to consider said case and to render
their verdict, towit:
ticipated
"I further charge you gentlemen of the jury
that before you would be authorized to convict the
defendant, M. T. Summerlin, you must belive from the
evidence produced to you beyond a reasonable doubt
that the said M. T. Summerlin was present and participate
in and did some overtact in the performance of said
operation alleged in' said presentment that is alleged
to have produced the abortionon the person of the said
Viola Parr. The mere performance of an operation by
another person than the accused to produce an abortion
in a room which is a part of the accused office is not
without more sufficient to convict him under this pre-
sen tment as principle in thefirst or second degree,
and there being no allegations as to the accused being
guilty as accessory before the fact. you would not be
authorized to convict the defendant as an accessory
before the fact."
Said error in not charging said written re-
quest was, as movant contends, as follows: There being
no alle gations in said presentment as to his being guilty
as an accessory before the fact, the court should have
charged as requested upon the subject of principles in
the first and second degree, and having refused to charge
said written request, same was error and defendant here
and now assigns the same as error, and there being no
evidence of the defendant being present, aiding and
abetting the act to be done, and there being no evidence
of the defendant having kept watch or guard at some
convenient distance while said abortion was produced,
the court committed error in refusing to charge the jury
as requested.
-9-
Because the court erred in charging the jury
upon the law of principals in the first and second
degree as relating to the second count of said presentment,
as follows:
"A person may be a principal in an offense in
two degrees. A principal in the first degree is the actor
or absolute perpetrator of the crime. A principal in the
second degree is he who is present, aiding and abetting
the act to be done, which presence need not always be an
actual immediate standing by, within sight or hearing of
the act; but there may be a constructive presence which
30


#11.
would be sufficient to make a party a principal in a
crime. By a constructive presence is meant such a state
of facts as to the place at which the alleged principal was
and his relation to the offense as that the jury would be
authorized to find that although actually not present at
the very place that the alleged crime was committed that
he was in legal contemplation presrnt at the commission
of the offense."
Movant contends and avers that the error of
said charge consisted of the following grounds, to-wit:
(a) There was no evidence establishing defendant's
guilt as principal in the second degree, and the court
should not have charged the law applicable thereto.
(b) There was no competent evidence to
connect the defendant with the commission of said crime
as principal in the second degree, and the court should
not have charged the law applicable thereto.
(c) The court erred in defining the law of
a principal in the second degree in that the court
attempted to define constructive presence as follows:
"By a constructive presence is meant such
a state of facts as to the place at which the alleged
principal was and his relation to the offense as that
the jury would be authorized to find that although
actually not present at the very place that the alleged
crime was committed that he was in legal contemplation
present at the commission of the offense."
Said error being: The court failed to explain
and define to the jury the meaning of "Legal Contemplation"
, and by not giving the meaning of "Constructive "presence
as defined by the Code Section, to-wit: "There may be
also a constructive presence as when one commits a robbery,
or murder, or other crime, and another keeps watch or
guard at some convenient distance."
Movant here and now contends that the giving
in charge to the jury the law applicable to a principal
in the second degree prejudiced the rights of defendant
before the jury and caused the jury to convict the
defendant of involuntary manslaughter in the comnission
of an unlawful act.
31


#12.
Movant here and now assigns as error said
portion of said charge to the jury upon the grounds
herein set forth in this ground of his amended motion.
-10-
Because the court comitted error in refusing
to give in charge the following request to charge as
relating to the second count of said presentment, same
having been submitted in writing to the judge before
he commenced his charge to the jury in said case and
before the jury retired to consider said case and to
render their verdict, to-wit:
"I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that
the word child as used in Sec. 81 of the Penal Code
which I have heretofore given you in charge means a
living child, that is to say, an unborn child so
far developed as to be ordinarily called "quick"
which has developed to that stage where it has moved
in the mother's womb, which is at four and on-half
months' development, and which is still alive when
the alleged unlawful means as alleged in said present-
ment were alleged to have been employed to produce
the alleged abortion upon the person of the said
Viola Parr as set out in the third count of this pre-
sentment. And I further charge you, genelemen of the
jury, that the burden is upon the State to satisfy your
minds to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt that the
child with which the said Viola Parr is alleged to have
been pregnant was such a child at the time it is alleged
in said presentment that said abortion was produced was
so far developed as to be "quick."
Movant contends and avers that the error of
the court in refusing to charge the jury as requested
consisted of the following grounds:
(a) Because before a conviction can be
had under the allegations in the sedond count of said
presentme nt the evidence must establish that the woman
was pregnant and that the child was quick and still
alive at the time the alleged abortion and offense
was committed, and if the child was not in fact alive
at said time there could be no conviction.
32


#13.
-11-
Because the court committed error in refusing
to give in charge the following request to charge as
relating to the second count of said presentment, same
having been submitted in writing to the judge before he
commenced his charge to the jury in said case and before
the jury retirned to consider said case and to render
their verdict, to-wit:
"I further charge you as to the second count
of said presentment that the State must establish from
the evidence to your satisfaction to the exclusion of a
reasonable doubt that each and every material allegation
of said second count has been proven. The material
allegations of said second count are as follows:
1. The use of some instrument or instruments
likely to produce death and by the use of said instru-
ment did inflict upon the person and body of Viola Parr
a mortal wound, and that from the effects of said wound
her death resulted, and that the child with which she is
alleged to have pregnant must have been quick as hereinbefore
explained to you before you would be authorized to convict
the defendant."
I further charge you gentlemen of the jury,
that if the State has failed to prove to your satisfaction
to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt all of the material
allegations in any one or all of said counts, it is your
duty to acquit the defendant in each count in which the
State has failed to prove to the exclusion of a reasonable
doubt the material allegations as therein set forth, and
that if the State has so failed to make out a. case it is
your duty to acquit the defendant."
Movant contends and avers that the errors of
the court in refusing to charge the jury as requested con-
sisted of the following grounds:
(a) The presentment in the second count
alleged the use of an instrument or instruments, and it
was necessary for the State to prove by competent
evidence the use of an instrument in producing said alleged
abortion
XARAR&tion, and a failure to establish by the testimony
alle ged
the use of an instrument in producing said abortion, the
state failed to prove one of the material allegations in
sajd second count, and the court therefore should have
charged said written request upon said subject.
33


#14.
(b) Because, before the defendant could be
legally convicted under the second count, the State
must establish from the testimony that a mortal wound
was inflicted by the use of an instrument upon the
person and body of the deceased, Viola Parr, and that
she died from the effects of said wound, and the court
not having charged as requested, and having failed to
charge the jury as to the use of an instrument or
instruments as relating to the second count in his
general charge, and as movant contends, the State having
failed to establish that said abortion was produced by
the use of an instrument or instruments as alleged in
said second count, it was error to refuse to charge the
jury as requested.
(c) Because if the State failed to prove
to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable
doubt any one or more of the material allegations set
forth in the second count , it was the duty of the
court to instruct and charge the jury as requested, and
direct the jury to acquit the defendant.
-12-
Because the court comnitted error in refusing
to give in charge the following request to charge as
relating to the second count of said presentment, same
having been submitted in writing to the judge before he
commenced his charge to the jury in said case and before
the jury retired to consider said case and to render
their verdict, to-wit:
"I further charge you, gentlemen of the jury,
that a room wherein an abortion may be or has been
committed is not evidence of the guilt of the owner of
the room of the abortion committed therein if there be
no other evidence of the participation of the owner of
said room in the perpetration of the alleged abortion.
3


#15.
Movant contends and avers that the error
of the court in refusing to charge the jury as requested
consisted of the following grounds:
The evidence as to the alleged dying
declaration that the abortion, if any, was produced,
was in the office of the accused, but failed to show
that the accused had any other connection there with
than that he was in and a bout there.
The record
further shows that he had a suite of four rooms for
his offices; one as a reception room; two operating
rooms, and one X-ray room on the fifth floor in the
Northwest corre of the Southern Mutual Building, and
that therefore the defendant was entitled to have given
in charge to the jury said written request.
Movant here and now assigns as error the
refusal of the court to so charge the jury as hereinbefore
set out in this his ground of amended motion.
-13-
Because the court committed error in charging
the jury upon the law of involuntary manslaughter in the
commission of an unlawful act as relating to the second
count of said presentment, as follows:
"After you have disposed of the first count
in the indictment by whatever verdict you may find, then
take up the second count, which charges the offense of
involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful
act, and, if, after giving due consideration to all of the
evidence and the prisoner's statement, you reach the con-
clusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is
guilty under that count, you would be authorized to so
find, and in that event the form your verdict would be,
we, the jury, find the defendant, M. T. Summerlin, guilty
of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an
unlawful act under the second count. .
On the other hand, if you are not satisfied
of his guilt under that count, or if you have a reasonable
doubt on your minds as to his guilt, you would be
authorized to acquit him, and in that event the form of
your verdict would be: we, the jury, find the defendant,
M. T. Summerlin, not guilty of involuntary manslaughter
in the commission of an unlawful act under the second count.
35


#16.
If killing shall happen in the commission of
an unlawful act, which, in its consequence, naturally
tends to destroy the life of a human being, the offense
shall be deemed and adjusged to be murder.
The second count of this indictment is as
follows; And the grand jurors aforesaid, in the name
and behalf of the citizens of Georgia, do further
charge and accuse the said w, G. Waters and M. T.
Summerlin with the offense of involuntary manslaughter
in the commission of an unlawful act, for that the said
W. G. Waters and M. T. Surmerlin, in the county and
state aforesaid, on the 20th day of February, in the
year of our Lord, 1919, with force and arms and without
any intention to do so, but in the commission of an
unlawful act, did unlawfully, feloniously and willfully
kill Viola Parr, the said Viola Parr being at the time a
pregnant woman, by then and there using and employing an
instrument and instruments to the grand jurors unknown,
which said instrument and instrument were by the said
W. G. Waters and M. T. Summerlin used and employed for
the purpose and with theintent thereby to produce the
miscarriage and abortion of the said Viola Parr, and by
the use and employment of said instrument and instruments
on the person of the said Viola Parr did thereby cause
and produce the miscarriage and abortion of said Viola
Parrand did thereby kill the said Viola Parr, the use
and employment of said instrument and instruments not being
then and there necessary to preserve the life of the said
Viola Parr and not having been ad vi sed by two physicians
to be necessary for that purpose; said W. G. Waters and
M. T. Summerlin in the manner and form aforesaid the said
Viola Parr did unlawfully, feloniously and willfully kill,
contrary to the laws of said state, the good order,
peace and dignity thereof.
Involuntary manslaughter shall consist in the
killing of a human being without any intention to do so,
but in the commission of an unlawful act, provided that
where such involuntary killing shall happen in the com-
mission of an unlawful act which, in its consequence, nat-
urally tends to destroy the life of a human being, the
offense shall be deemed and adjud ged to be murder.
*x&xxxxxxX The law provides that if any
person shall willfully administer to any pregnant woman
any medicine, drug or substance, or anything whatever,
or shall employ any instrument or means viha
intent thereby to produce the miscarriage or abortion of
any such woman, unless the same shall have been necessary
to preserve the life of such woman, or shall have been
advised by two physicians to be necessary for that purpose,
he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
KAZI charge you, therefore, gentlemen, if there
is any person who does the acts which are prohibited
in the section of the code, which I have just read to
you, that such person commits an unlawful act, and I
charge you that it is not necessary, in orde
it is not necessary, in order to make the
offense defined and punished by that section, that it
should appear that the foetus in the mother's womb was
quick, but all that is necessary to be shown, in order to
be an unlawful act under that section, is that the woman
was a pregnant woman, even in the first stages of pregnancy,


#17
and if the acts are done which are prohibited in that
section on such woman, the doing of these acts would be
an unlawful act, althoughthe child do not be quick in
the mother's womb. I, therefore, charge you that if in
the doing of the unlawful act prohibited in this section
death resulted to the mother, but that there was no
intention to kill, that the person responsible for the
death would be guilty of the offense of involuntary
manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act.
Now, gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the
entire charge read. I
2 these addi ion, instructions
in reference to the third count, and if there is any
difference between what I say now and what I said in the
original charge you follow the instructions I give you
now.
Involuntary manslaughter shall consist in the
killing of a human being without any intention to do so,
but in the commission of an unlawful act.
I charge you that the law declares it unlawful
for any person to willfully administer to any pregnant
woman any medicine, drug or substance, or anything
whatever, or to employ an instrument or means whatever,
with intent thereby to produce the miscarriage or abortion
of any such woman, unless the same shall have been
necessary to preserve the life of such woman, or shall
have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for
that purpose.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that those
acts which have been des cribed in the section of the
Code that I have read in your hearing wouad consitute
an unlawful act wi thin the meaning of the law, and if
those acts are done by a person so denounced to be un-
lawful and as a consequence of such unlawful act the
death of a person results, then the person committing the
unlawful act would be guilty of the offense of involuntary
manslaughter in the commission of an unlawful act, provided
that if the unlawful act referred to is found by you to
be an act which naturally tends to destroy the life of a
human being, then the offense would be deemed and adjudged
to be murder.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that you
cannot find the defendant guilty on both the first and
second count,- that in order to find the defendant guilty
the first count there must be, as I say, evidence
which would show an intention to kill, or such a state of
facts in connection with the performance of an unlawful
act which would apply the evidence of intention and
malice,- that is an unlawful act which naturally tends
to destooy the life of a human being. The fist of the
offense under the second count is the killing as a result
of anunlawful act but the intention to kill would not be
present. And, therefore, the two offenses charged would
be inconsistent with each other, and, therefore, I charge
you that if you find the defendant guilty under the first
count that you would find the defendant not guilty under
the second count, and that if you find the defendant
guilty under the second count that you would not find him
not guilty under the first count."


#18.
Movant contends and avers that said charge
as herein set out in this ground of his amended motion
upon the law of involuntary manslaughter in the
commission of an unlawful act was error for the following
reasons:
(a) The allegations of the second count does
not constitute said crime of involuntary manslaughter in
the commission of an unlawful act, but that said
allegations are embraced in the crime defined in the
specific statute as set forth under $81 of the Penal
Code of Georgia of 1910, as assault with intent to
murder, and, therefore, the court should not have
charged the jury upon said law of involuntary manslaughter
in the commission of an unlawful act.
-14-
Because the court committed error in charging
the jury upon the presumption of innocence as follows:
"The law presumes every person to be innocent
of crime until his guilt has been established in the
manner prescribed by law, and this presumption remains
with a man throughout his trial until it is overcome by
evidence which satisfies the mind and the conscience of
the jury of the guilt of the accused of the crime charged
in the indictment, or, if there are one or more counts in
the indictment, of one of more of the counts of the
crimes charged in the several counts."
Movant contends and avers that the error in
said poution of said charge was in not instructing the
jury that the presumption of innocence remains with a man
"in the nature of evidence in his behalf" throughout
his entire trial until it is overcome by evidence which
satisfies the mind and the conscience of the jury of the
guilt of the accused of the crime charged in the indictment
beyond a reasonable doubt.
The court in charging the jury failed to instruct
the jury that said presumption was in the nature of
evidence in his behalf and that said presumption went
38


#19.
with him through his entire trial, and failed to inform
the jury that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt of the guilt of the accused before said presumption
of innocence could or would be overcome; and that if they
were not so satisfied to the exclusion of and beyond a
reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused that said
presumption of innocence would authorize and require them
to acquit the defendant.
.-15.
Because the court failed to charge the jury as
to the necessity of the State proving one of the material
allegations in the second count of said presentment as
tosaid operation not having been advised by two physicians
to be necessary to preserve the life of said woman.
Said allegations of said second count being a
material allegation, and as movant contenderet contends
the State failed to prove said allegation; it was error
for the court not to charge the jury as follows:
"Before you would be authorized to convict
the defendant under the second count you must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has
established from the evidence that said alleged
operation was performed by the defendant, M. T. Summerlin,
or that he was present and aiding and advising the same
to be done as hereinbefore explained, without the same
first having been advised by two physicians to be
necessary to save the life of the woman upon whom the
alleged abortion, iÃ alleged to have been produced, and
if you are not so satisfied that the State has established
said material alle gation beyond a reasonable doubt, you
should acquit the defendant."
Movant here and now avers and contends that
the court committed error in failing to so charge the
jury, and assigns the same as error.


#20.
-16-
Because the court committed error in not
charging the jury upon the law as relating to the
direct cause of the death of the deceased under the
second count, and for grounds thereof, movant says:
(a) Movant contends that the evidence showed
that Dr. J. C. Holliday performed several operation on
deceased, and that the death of the deceased could
have been produced and caused from the operation per-
formed by Dr. J. C. Holliday and not the operation
and defendant
claimed to have been performed by Dr. W. G. Waters, and it
was therefore error for the court not to charge the jury
that if they had a reasonable doubt as to which one of the
operations produced the abortion or caused the death of
the deceased it would be the duty of the jury to acquit
the defendant, and if the jury had a reasonable doubt
claimed to have been
as to whether the operation performed by Dr. W. G.
and defendant alleged
Water produced the , abortion or caused her death it would
be the duty of the jury to acquit the defendant, M. T.
Summerlin.
The testimony of Dr. J. C. Holliday as to
performing the operations on deceased is as follows:
"I examined, her abdomen extended, and found
that she had an enlargement and the seemed to be in the
lower part of the stomach, lower part of the abdomen,
and I found that her womb was enlarged, wasn't quite
as big as my two iists, but about as large as a
orange, and I noticed intermittent contractions.
So, I went away and come back late in the afternoon
and the foetus had passed and some of the afterbirth
hadn't passed. I saw the foetus had passed away by making
an examination and I found out also a portion of the
afterbirth hadn't passed. I was called back later that
night about eleven o'clock and she was in extreme pain
again, and so I sterilized a speculum and a pair of
dressing forceps and attempted to remove that remained
and I found a portion was hanging just outside of the
uterus that hadn't passed away, and I removed it and I
could tell by the way it broke in vwo there was some more
inthe uterus. I made an antiseptic solution and put my
instruments in the antiseptic solution and poured the
boiling water over them, - put the tablets in the bowl
and put the instruments inand pured the boiling water
on all of it,- in other woods scalded them again. I
40


#21.
used a syringe, - first cleansed the parts with an
antiseptic solution and then I used a syringe with
cyanide of mercury, which is an antiseptic, and I gave
her a douche before I used the speculum. All I did was
to take a dull blunt instrument and remove the portion
of the after birth that still femained."
The court having failed to so charge the
jury movant here and now assigns the same as error.
-17-
Because the court committed error in charging
the jury as to the second count of said presentment the
law of involuntary manslaughter in the commission of an
unlawful act, as follows:
"The law provides that if any person shall
willfully administer to any pregnant woman any medicine
drug or substance, or anything whatever, or shall
employany instrument or means whatever, with intent
thereby to produce the miscarriage or abortion of any
such woman, unless the same shall have been necessary
to preserve the life of such woman, or shall have been
advised by two physicians to be necessary for that
purpose, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
I charge you, therefore, gentlemen, if there
is any person who does the acts which are prohibited
in the section of the code, which I have just read to
you, that such person commits an unlawful act."
After the jury had been out in their room
for about two and one-half hours considering said case
and after the court had charged the jury, returned to
the court room and requested the court to re-charge
the jury,


#22.
Whereupon the court had the court reporter to read his
notes to the jury of the charge originally given to the
jury, and upon the conclusion of the reading of said
charge to the jury, the court as an additional charge
on the subject of involuntary manslaughter in the
sommission of an unlawful act as relating to the second
count of said presentment charged the jury as follows:
"I charge you that the law declares it unlawful
for any person to willfully administer to any pregnant
woman any medicine, drug or substance, or anything
whatever, or to employ an instrument or means whatever,
with intent thereby to produce the miscarriage of abortion
of any such woman, unless the same shall have been
necessary to preserve the life of such woman, or shall
have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for
that purpose.
I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that those
acts which have been described in the section of the
Code that I have read in your hearing would constitute
an unlawful act within the meaning of the law, and if
those acts are done by a person so denounced to be unlaw-
ful and as a consequence of such unlawful act the death
of a person results, then the person committing the unlawful
act would be guilty of the offense of involuntary manslaugh-
ter in the commission of an unlawful act."
Movant contends and avers that said portion of
said charge as herein set out in this ground of his amended
motion upon the law of involuntary manslaughter in the
commission of an unlawful act was error for the following
reasons:
(a) the court charged the jury all of the means by
which an abortion could be produced as constituting an
illegal act, whereas the State only charged in the
allegations of the second count that the alleged abortion

not guilty assigns no error in said original motion or
in this his amended motion as to said verdicts of not

BRIEF OF EVIDENCE INTRODUCED AND SUBMITTED
TO THE JURY IN THE ABOVE STATED CASE INCLUD-
ING THE DEFENDANT'S STATEMENT.
MRS. G. D. PARR, Sworn for the State, Testified as
follows:
I am Mrs. G, D, Parr, and live at 1689 South
Lumpkin; I have lived there for the past thirty or thirty
four years. I am the mother of Viola Parr; she was
thirty-three last October, - I mean twenty-three. She
is dead now; she died the first day of last March. She
worked for Dr. Summerlin ever since last June up until
the 20th day of February. She came home sick on the
afternoon of February 20th; she was very sick at the
time she came home, and was very weak. On Friday night
after she came home sick Thursday afternoon, we called
young Dr. J. C. Holliday; he came Friday night about
eleven o'clock the first time. The Doctor took her
temperature and it was 103; she was suffering greatly;
that was on Friday night. She lived until Saturday
following, - Saturday week. When he came to see her the
first time, that was on Friday night, the 21st, and she
died the 28th of February. During that time her condition
just got worse all the time; she had high temperature.


#2.
I did not know what was the matter with her until she
told me Friday afternoon before she died the next day
on Saturday. She had been very sick all day Friday.
She died on the 1st day of March, - on Saturday; she
talked to me on Friday, the 28th of February; she was
just in a dying condition, it seemed like. She told
me that the doctor had told he she had to die, and said
she knew she had to due and she had some thing she wanted
to tell me; said she had done wrong and had been in a
pregnant condition, and I asked her who was it, and she
said Dr. Summerlin; she said Dr. Summerlin was the waune
of it; said they performed an operation on her, and
I asked her who was they, and she said Dr. Summerlin and
Dr. Waters. The operation was performed in Dr. Summerlin's
office; they made her swear she wouldn't tell it.
I saw Dr. Summerlin during the time of the sickness of
my daughter; he was the one that admi nistered the gas;
it was Sunday morning after she came home Thursday
afternoon sick, - Sunday morning about ten or ten-thirty.
From the time she came home on Thursday night until she
died the following Saturday week, she was getting worse
all the time; she said the operation was performed on
Thursday. i That was fauclarke County.
CROSS EXAMINATION OF Mrs. G. D. Parr:
I say Dr. Summerlin administered gas to my
daughter at my home on Sunday following her being taken
sick on Thursday, - on the Thursday before. Dr. J. C.
Holliday and Mrs. C. W. Fillingham were present when
that was done. The reason Dr. Summerlin came to my house
to administer the gas is that my daughter wanted him to
administer the gas because she said ether made her
sick after she woke up, - she was sick at her stomach
from it and the gas didn't make her sick and she wanted
him to administer it,- the gas. Some one phoned to Dr.


SumerÃ¨in that she wanted him to give her the gas. I was
in the room at the time the gas was being administered
to her, and I understood that an operation was being
done; she told me they were going to have an operation
performed because her womb had turned around and her
menstruation, she hadn't menstruated since September ist;
that is what she told me way before this happened, that
she was going to be operated on for that. She told me
way before this operation, - this occasion about her
irregular menstruation,- that she had not menstruated
since September 1st, and I know she hadn't. Dr. J. C.
Holliday was the doctor who was supposed to perform the
operation; he didn't perform any operation; he only
took the clots and things, - he just removed the clots
of blood; that was the operation that Dr. Summerlin ad-
ministered the gas for. Dr. Summerlin, Dr. J. C.
Holliday and Mrs. C. W. Fillingham were in the room at the
time; I knew that Dr. Summerlin was there for the purpose
of adminisering the gas. I had occasion recently to
testify about my daughter's condition before the grand
jury in Clarke County; I remember the occasion, and I
remember telling them she made this statement to me.
I told the grand jury in my testimony before them; I
cart remember word for word what I stated to the
grandjury her statement was to me before she died; it
was in substance that Dr. Summerlin had ruined her and
that it was Dr. Waters that performed the operation; I
stated that to the grand jury; I remember while I was
testifying before the grand jury that I didn't know
anything about it myself; not until she told me, - I
never dreamed of such a thing not until she told me
Friday before she died Saturday.
