didn't
I remember that I, myself, telephoned to Dr. Summerlin
that night to come to the house and give the gas, but
I telephoned Sunday morning, and his wife answered the
phone, and I told her they wanted him to come they
had decided they would have it, I think about one or
two o'clock Sunday, and Dr. Holliday decided he would
have it earlier and I just phoned and told her to tell
him they were going to have it earlier. I, myself,
telephoned Sunday monring telling her they were going
to have it earlier.
MRS. G. D. PARR on re-direct examination:
On Sunday morning at the time of this operation
at which Dr. Summerlin was called, that was previous to
my knowledge of the real condition of my daughter. I
hadn't any idea of such a thing. That was Sunday before
she died the next Saturday and I didn't know.
She was staying at my house on the 20th of February, and
had been staying the re pegularly during the period
previous to that time. I know she had been sick that
morning when she went away from my house to Dr. Summerlin's
office on Thursday morning, - she hadn't been hardly
able to go to work for a long time, but I didn't have
any idea what was cuasing the sickness; As to her
general appearance as to health, she was a bde to go on
and do her work. I know about her condition as to her
menstruation.


DR. J. C. HOLLIDAY sworn for the State, testified
as follows:
My nameis Dr. J. C. Holliday, and I live in
Athens, Clarke County, I am a practicing physician and
surgeon and have been since 1909. I was in Athens in
the year 1918 until the 31st day of August and I re-
ported to Camp Greenleaf and went in the army/ I was
discharged on the 30th day of January, 1919, and came
back and resumed the practice of medicine. I am not
the regular family physician of Mrs. G. D. Parr, but
they would call me in sometimes, and Dr. A. C. Holliday
was their regular family physician and he was away. He
was in Florida. I recall when I was called in to the
home of Mrs. Parr. I was called in to see Miss Viola
Parr on the 21st day of February at eleven o'clock at
night. She seemed to be in very much pain and I
examined her, took her temperature and found it to be
103 and I examined her abdomen extended, and found that
she had an enlargment and the pain seemed to be inthe
lower part of the stomach, lower part of the abdomen,
and I found that her womb was enlarged, wasn't quite as
big as my two fists, but about as large as a large orange,
and I noticed intermittent contractions. When the pain
was on, of course, the womb would knot up axot which
showed she was in labor. I asked her mother and another
lady, Mrs. Fillingham, whQ was present, if she had
menstruated any that day, if her flow had started, and
they told me it had, - been right profuse all day. So I
rendered my hands as aseptic as I could and I cleaned
the parts and made an examination afid found that her womb was


#6.
slightly dilated. She was in such extreme pain I gave
her a hypodermic of morphine and told her it would ease
her some but owing to her condition I didn't think it
would be advisable to entirely ease her, to entirely
remove the pain, because she was in such condition it
wouldn't be wi se to do it. When I asked for some warm
water her mother and Mrs. Fillingham went for the water
and while she was out I asked Miss Viola if she wasn't
miscarrying and she said no, she didn't see how she
could be, she wasn't pregnant. I told her I knew she
was and she would have to tell the whole condition or
else I couldnt afford to have anything to do with it.
So, her mother and Mrs. Fillingham came back in the room
and that was the end of the conversation. I came back
the following morning and still the foetus hadn't passed.
She was still in pain. That was the following morning,
Saturday morning, the 22nd. I advised them it was
best not to ease her and I told her in the absence of
her mother that she must bear to her pains and get rid
of the foetus, that the abortion was really inevitable,-
it was coming no matter what was done and the best thing
to do was to pass it off and get through with it as soon
as she could. So, I went away and come back late in the
afternoon and the foetus had passed and some of the
afterbirth hadn't passed.
I saw the foetus had passed away by making an
examination and I found out also a portion of the
afterbirth hadn't passed. So, I made a prescription for
her for some fluid extract of ergot to take to bring about
contractions of the womb. At that time she was entirely
easy, - and to bring about contractions 88 as to expel
what remained in the uterus. I was called back later
that night about eleven o'clock and she was in extreme
pain again, and so I sterilized a speculum and a pair
of dressing forceps and attempted to remove what
49


remained and I found a portion was hanging just outside
of the uterus that hadn't passed away, and I removed it
and I could tell by the way it broke in two there was
some more in the uterus. In this portion I removed was
the cord, which was a bout the size of a lead pencil, and
possibly the part I saw was about six or eight inches long.
I didn't measure it. I told Miss Viola there was a
portion there that hadn't passed and I would have to re-
move it the following morning. I was really afraid of
the technique that night and at that time I hadn't even
placed an intrument in the uterus. So, she asked me
if she might call it an operation. At that time nobody
knew it and I told her as far as I was concerned it would
be perfectly all right and in reality it was a small
operation. When her mother came back in the room she
told her mother she was going to have a little operation
next day and I told her mother some thing in her womb I
wanted to remove. She asked if she might take an
anaesthetic and I told her I didn't think it was really
necessary; I thought I could remove it without an
anaesthetic. She said "I have suffered so much pain I
don't think I can stand any more and I would like to have
an anaesthetic." She says "how about Dr. Summerlin
coming out and giving me cas." I say "it is agreeable
with me if you want him, but it is perfectly all right."
So, it was agreed to that he would come out next morning
and give her gas for me to remove this portion of the
af terbirth that hadn't passed away. I was to meet him
at nine o'clock; when I got there I was a few minutes
late. He was there. So, I had my instruments in a
towel and had previously sterilized them and at that
time I got them to boil some water and bring me some
boiling water and made an antiseptic solution and put my


#8.
instruments in the antiseptic solution and pured the
boiling water over them, - put the tablets in the bowl
and put the instruments in and pured the boiling water
on all of it,- in other words scalded them again. I
used a syringe, - first cleansed the parts with an antiseptic
solution and then I used a syringe with cyanide of
mercury, which is an antiseptic, and I gave her a douche
before I used the speculum. All I did was to take a
dull blunt instrument and remove the portion of the
afterbirth that still remained. I didn't see her any
more until ta-following morning which was Monday morning,
Realizing all the time during this time she had run of
temperature, which, of course, after the foetus passed
wasn't as high, but still she had some temperature. So,
Monday, I gave her some more ergot and gave her some quinine
andalso a purgative and followed up my treatment the best
I could. So, on Tuesday she was apparently doing farily
well,- of course, still septic. Wednesday she had a
severe chili, on Wednesday morning. So, I still kept
my treatment going and asked for consultation and she
refused, - said she wouldn't have any consultation. I
told her mother I would like to have some body in the
case with me, I didn't care for all the responsibility,
and so her mother said she would see her and let me know.
So, the next time I come back, which I believe was that
afternoon, her mother told me she had refused to have
anybody else and the ywere perfectly satisfied with
what I was doing. So, Thursday, she continued to grow
worse and - Friday I realized her condition; I realized
that she couldn't get well; I mean by realizing her con-
dition, I realized she was going to die. So, she told me
Friday herself she knew she couldn't get well. She said
she had told her mother about the whole affair. So, I
asked again for a consultation, that there might be some-
thing else we could do and her mother asked me to wait
51


#9.
until the following morning. And so the following
morning Dr. A. C. Holliday was called out there. He
came before I got there. I expected to meet him there.
I was detained and when I got there he had been there
and gone. In a little while he came back. So, I told
Miss Viola we had done all we could for her and that
she was going to die, and there wasn't anything else
that could be done, that I wanted her to tell in my presence,
to tell Dr. Hilliday just the truth about it; I says "let
the chips fall where they will". She says "it is just as
I have told you." I said what did you tell me." She
said "I told you that Dr. Summerlin was responsible for
my condition and that Dr. Waters produced the abortion,"
I says "where did he do it"; she says "in Dr. Summerlin's
office." So, that concluded our conversation. That
condluded the statement she made to me as a dying statement.
She went on that afternoon and died about one o'clock or
one-thirty.
The primary cause of her death was due to the
abortion, and the secondary casue was the septic condition-,
septicaumia. I mean by the secondary cause septicaemia;
that was caused by the abortion, and the abortion or
miscarriage was the direct cause of the death. There
was evidence of a sikukias dilatation of the cervix
which was done to cause the condition; the common thing
used is a dilator, - uterine dilator. The instrument you
hand to meis a uterine dressing forceps. That is not a
dilator. That could be possibly used for a dilator but
that is not a uterine dilator. When I made the examination
I noticed there was an infection around the edges, - some
small fissues showed points of infection; they were white
and mattery looking.


#10.
A young girl, that is a primipara, a girl that has her
first baby, where there has never been a dilatation,
the uterus is very resistent and some times they
will tear a little bit rather than dilate readily and
this is the way it seems to have been, which caused a
laceration of that sort. A dilator had been used is my
knowledge, - that is, it is my belief, had been used to
cause this. I didn't see it used. It had evidences of
a dilator having been used. A dilator is an instrument
used for purposes of that kind. An instrument of that
kind in an unskilled hand is dangerous, - liable to
produce death. As the physician of Miss Parr I do not
know whether it was necessary nu or not to preserve
her life to perform that operation; I don't see why it
should be. As the family physician down there I did
not advise anything of that kind and I do not know of
anyone else that did.
DR. J. C. HOLLIDAY, on cross examination:
I say that a dilator is generally used to
dilate the mouth of the womb.
A dilator is an instrument
made some thing on this order except it is made reverse, -
instead of these prongs closing they come together and
when you pull this end this end opens, - made just opposite
from this instrument. That is the particular kind of
dilator that I have in mind. I do notmean to say
that is the only kind of dilator that could be used,
speaking about the regular uterine dilator. I mean
by that anything would be a uterine dilator that dilated
the uterus. I do not know of my own knowledge what
was used. I meant or have in mind a certain kind of an
instrument that is called a uterine dilator and that is
the onby connection your I can make with it. The neck of
the womb could be, if it was necessary to do it, dilated
with the finger, it has been done, but it owing to how
IS
53


#11.
resistent it is. Of course, it has been done with the
finger, and in a comparatively normal womb. A clothes
pin couldn't be used as a dilator; it is too large, -
the opening of the womb is very small. You could
complete a dilation of the womb with a clothes pin, but
it is rather a crude instrument. I don't think you could
get there safely by putting tallow or grease on it to
prevent an abrasion of the cervis of the uterus. I
suppose I came in the days of instruments, and before the
dys of instruments they had to get along without uterine
dilators. I can tell you about another way to dilate
the womb is to use small instruments made of rubber,
or fingers,- place one in a place and another side of it.
I don't think you could dilate the womb with a pen staff
or lead pencil or any smooth-pointed round instrument, -
it is a n owing to how resistent it was. If easily
dilated you might possibly do it. In case of a primi para
where the uterus had never been dilated, it would be a
different proposition. It would not necessarily depend
upon the age of the party. A young person's wond that
had never been dilated would be harder to dilate than
one that had been. At the time I went there and found
this womb was grabbing I undertook to bring about an
expulsion from it of its ontents after it had progressed
to a certain stage. The foetus hadn't passed; the foetus
was still in the womb; the afterbirth was still in the
womb. Some dilatation and some protrusion of the water
sack was within the womb; she was having a severe
hemoragage; that hemorrhage showed where the afterbirth
had been torn away from the womb. Where the afterbirth
is attached it is very rich in bdood vessels, - when
there is a rupture there the blood flows freely, and I
call that an extravasation of the inner walls of the
womb, - that is what it is really.


#12.
The water sack was unbroken but it was protruding out
where the dilatation was, but the foetus was within
the water sack and the water was in the water sack. I
didn't consider that it was absolutely a provision of
nature for passing the foetus through the mouth of the
womb and out into the world with safety to the party,
foetus and everything else, - that is with a water cushion
that adjusts itself according to the position of the foetus
in the uterus- for the reason that she had high temperature
and showed she was in a septic condition. I mean by septic
condition there was some poisoning in the blood and that
manifests itself by high fever; that is one of the
manifestations of septic conditions.
Q. Isn't it possible she could have been in that condition,
fererish from poison, septicaemia as you call it, from
whatever causes or sources, and where the contents of the
womb would have been such as they might have been delivered?
A. She showed that the uterus was contracting down very
hard on this mass and from the amount of hemorrhage she
was having, which she had had all day, so the ones in the
room told me, showed that there had been some thing there
that really had done the damage, had started the severe
hemorrhage; that was the hemorrhage. I saw what was
supposed to have caused it, - the pieces of afterbirth
that came away in torn pieces,- came away in pieces that
showed possibly it had been torn up by a dilator. It
was very odorous and showed some foreign septic matter
had been introduced there.
I mean it was malodorous. I
would say odorous,- fetid odors. On Sunday morning it
had a severe odor, and as conditions progressed the
fetid conditions increased.
The contractions. of the
womb that had taken place up to the time I was called
in had not resulted in expelling the foetus, - it couldn't
have, - it was still in the womb.
55


#13.
I did not do anything according to my best
medical judgment to complete the expulsion of the foetus
from the womb;, I gave her ergot to complete the expulsion
of the afterbirth; that would be part of the contents of
thu womb. I would not give her ergot whether the foetus
had been expelled or not to expel the contents of the
womb; I never gave ergot with the foetus in the womb, because
I don't think it is a good practice. What you want with
ergot is to complete your contraction of the fundus. If
the foetus hasn't been expelled and still in the womb I
don't give ergot; it contract's the cervix as well and will
prevent the opening. The way it differs from the
expulsion when it is necessary to expel the placenta,
or afterbirth is the dilatation has already taken place
and it is just a contraction there that empties it. I
didn't mean to say that the effect of ergot is solely
on the fundus of the womb and leaves the mouth of the
womb entirely unaffected, unconstricted and annontracted;
I said it would prevent a dilatation of the cervix. Before
the foetus is expelled the dilatation has already taken
place and then it will empty the contents of the uterus.
The expusion of the foetus as. distinguished from other
contents of the womb, - the expulsion of the foetus and
the expulsion of the placenta is the same sort of
physiodogical action,- the same kind of physical action.
I would not resort to the same means, the same agencies,
to expel the placenta from a womb, when it ought to be
e xpelled, at I would to expel the foetus, when it ought
to be expelled; in cases where the foetus has not been
as
expelled I get a dilatation of the cervix which is
necessary as a passage for the foetus to pass through; if
you give ergot in those cases you bring about a contract-
ion of your cervix which you don't want. After the foetus
has been expelled and the thorough dilatation taken place,


#14.
then whatever contents there are in the uterus by a
simple contract of the uterus will bring the contents
near the cervix where it will either pass out or you
can remove it. After everything passes the womb contracts
at the neck. When the womb is once dilated it remains
dilated several days before the contraction. Of course,
there is slight contraction. Suppo se contraction has
taken place to a point that the afterbirth will not
pass after the foetus has passed,- the effedt of giving
ergot will slightly increase the compression of the
muscles of the fundus of the womb; but since dilatation
has taken place it usually passes offf or passes down
where you can reach it without going into the fundus.
That is the tendency of the ergot; the tendency of the
ergot is to bring about contraction of the muscular
tissues of the whole womb, - fundus and neck and everywhe re
else. I don't know positively the age of that foetus; I
would say at least ten weeks. The time ordinarily
recognized for a foetus to be called quick varies from
ten weeks to five months, and in some cases they never
feel the foetus; it can be a perfectly normal child
without the mother feeling the moves, but that is the
exception, - usually feel it about four or four and a half
months, - that is the normal time in a normal case. The
foetus moving within the uterus amounts to this quickening.
The uterus enlarges, and as it enlarges it presses on
and impinges in the abdominal cavity the viscera, then
you have that contact between the constantly enlarging
uterus and the adjacent viscera and then the possibility
of feeling motion is very much more acute in the mother.

DR. J. C, HOLLIDAY, on Re-Cross Examination:
I did not do a thing to expel the foetus
before it had passed. The first time I used an
instrument in the womb was on Sunday morning, and Mrs.
Fillingham and Dr. Sumerlin were present.
DR. J. C. HOLLIDAY on Direct Examination, re-called:
A woman in the stages of pregnancy as Miss
Parr was at this time, who was able to perform her usual
duties and engage in work up to that day, I would not
deem it necessary in my jusgment as a physician to have
preserved her life to have performed that operation on
the day it was. The afterbirth passed in fragments, and
the cause of its passing in fragments was due to either
of two things,- decomposition caused by bacteria or it
had been torn by an instrument. I saw the mouth of the
womb and examined it, and I saw where the dilatation had
been done; there were little fissures seemed to have
been infected; it seemed to have been done with an
instrument.
DR. J. C. HOLLIDAV on Cross Examination:
What convinced me that it was done with an
instrument was just inside the cervix, we walk will call
them lacerations or fissures. They were very small and
showed exactly like a mattery sore; it was very small,-
these fissures were very small; some thing like a crack
in the lip, or in the corner of the lip, or where the
mouth had been stretched and cold wind blew on it, or
some thing of that sort, and slightly mattered matters
there.

A. C. HOLLIDAY, sworn for the State, testified
as follows:
My name is Dr. A. C. Holliday, and I live
in Athens, and am engaged in the practice of medicine, -
I have been practicing medicine thirty-five years. I
know Mrs. G. D. Parr, and have been her family physician
for several years. I was called to her home on March
1st, this year, - Saturday, March 1st, to see Miss Viola
Parr; I found her in a dying condition when I got there,
and I didn't make any examination, just only a slight
examination; I examined the pulse and inspected her; I
didn't make any internal examination at all, and I told
her she was dying, and she told me that Dr. Summerlin was
responsible for her condition and Dr. Waters had produced
the abortion on her. I asked then if she had had a
miscarriage and she said she had and I asked her how ----
Shej said the miscarriage or abortion was produced in Dr.
Summerlin's office. She went into details, I asked her, -
I says "how did he do it"; she said Dr. Waters had pro-
dueed the abortion and I said "how did he do it"; she
said "he opened my womb" or"dilated my womb", - I don't
remember which she said, one or the other; I think she
said "he dilated my womb". I says to her "did he
hurt you" and she said "not much". I also asked her
"where was Dr. Summerlin" and she said "he was in and
around about there." I do not think a woman that is in
a state of pregnancy, as she was, able to do her work
and was off on the job at that time, that an operation
of that kind was necessary for the purpose of saving her
life. An operation of that character is a dangerous one
and liable to produce death. I have been the family phy-
si cian for a number of years. I did not knonx advise or
59


#17.
know anything about the ad vi ce of any physician that it
was necessary for that purpose. I had beenmout of the
city for nearly three weeks prior to this time. I came
home on Monday and I was called the fast following
Saturday to see Miss Parr. I think I have known Miss
Parr ever since she was a small little girl, - I had
been their family physician for fifteen years. She
was not a married woman, she was a single girl. I had
a conversation with Dr. Summerlin after my second visit
out there. After my first visit when I found her
pulseless and dying and all I gave her a hypodermic of
strychinine and went to my office and I was there and I
soon got a telephone message to come back over there,
Dr. Carl Holliday had gotten there and wanted me to come
back over there to see her; so I made the second visit
to see Miss Perr. After I went then back to my office,
my office boy had a message for me that Dr. Summerlin
wanted to see me, or left a message for me to call him
when I came in.
I called Dr. Summerlin over the telephone
and I had a conversation with him. I says "Dr. Summerlin,
this is Dr. Holliday, - I have a message that you wanted
to speak to me"; he said "yes, I have had two or three
telephone calls, they wanted me to tell you to go and see
Miss Viola Parr"; I said "I have just come from there,
doctor"; I says "the young lady is dying and she accused
you of being, in her deathbed statement, she accused you
of being responsible for her condition and Dr. Waters
producing the abortion." I says "furthermore her
brothers know about it and it was all we could do to
keep them from going funning for you right at once." I
said "you better keep a sharp lookout for them." Dr.
Summerlin says "I am not guilty." He says "can I see you
if I come down to your office a minute"; I told him "yes".
I didn't have any rfurther conversation with Dr. Surmerlin.
I shouldn't think it was over three or five minutes
60


#18.
after the conversation with Dr. Summerling before I saw
him; he was at the foot of the elevator in the lobby
of the Southern Mutual Building lying down on the
floor, - that was a bout three minutes after I had had
the conversation with him, - not over five, - from three
to five,- in which I told him she was dying. When I
found him down there he seemed to be dazed, but he was
conscious.
I examined his pulse and saw they were very
good. Dr. Fullilove got there before I did; and I had
him to show me his tongue and I examined his eyes and I
saw he was reacting all right; they said he had fainted.
And Dr. Full1love suggested he put him in his car and
send him to his home, and as I wasn't Dr. Summerlin's
physician I got on the elevator and went back to my office.
When I found Dr. Summerlin at the foot of the elevator
I shouldsay it was about ten thirty in the morning. I
am not positive as to the exact time. I do not know
what became of Dr. Surme rlin after that time. My office
in on the third floor of the Southern Nutual Building
and Dr. Summerlinus is on the sixth floor in the Southern
Mutual Building. I don't know that he was about his
office after that time any more, but I didn't frequent
his office, - I don't know. That building is in Clarke
County; that is where his office is up there. I had
that conversation with him the first day of March this
year. Dr. Summerlin has not been back to his office,
of my knowlegge, since that time. I don't know whether
he has been in Athens since that thee; I haven't seen
him, - not of my knowledge.


#19.
DR. A. C. HOLLIDAY on Cross Examination:
WHEN I called Dr. Summerlin up in answer to
that communication to me that he wanted to talk with
me over the phone and told him the young lady was
dying, - I told hr. Summerlin Miss Parr was dying, and
in addition I told him some thing about her brothers. I
said to Dr. Summerlin when he told me what he wanted, -
he said he wanted me to go over to see Miss Parr, - I
told him, I says "Doctor, I have just come from over
there and Miss Parr is dying, - she accuses you of being
responsible for her condition and Dr. Waters as having
produced the abortion." I says "her brothers know
a bout it and it was all we could do to keep them from
going gunning for you right on the spot,- you better
keep a lookout for them." He says, "I am not guilty."
I didn't say anything further to him about his keeping
out of the way or staying out of the way ofher brothers, -
I just put him on that notice. When Dr. Carl Holliday
and myself told her brothers what Miss Parr's condition
was and her dying statement Frank Parr, he was the first
one we told, he started out, he was going right to the
office and kill Dr. Sumraerlin; we prevailed on him not
to do it, that his mother was begging for her sake not
to have any more, she had all she could stand, And when
Charley Parr came up a few minutes later we told him the
same story and Charley Parr got out to the street to his
car, he was going to go and kill Dr. Summerlin right
at once and I feared they were going to go and do it,
and I simply told him as I understood what the facts were.
My purpose was enable him to avoid a collission with
the se two brothers.

MRS. C. W. FILLINGHAM, sworn for the State, testified
as follows:
My name is Mrs. C. W. Fillingham, and I live
on the Princeton road. I suppose if it was cut up in
blocks it would be some thing like three blocks from
Mrs. Parr, - I imagine it would be that distance. I can
call the day of the week I was at krs. Parris, but I
can't call the date in my mind. On Friday night of
February I was there,- it was the night Dr. Carl
Holliday wascalled there. Miss Parr was suffering
intense pain at that time. I was there on Friday night,
the night you are speaking of, I stayed until about
twelve o'clock; then I went home. Then I came back on
Saturday night and I stayed all night Saturday night
with her. They performed the operation on Sunday
morning and I was there and helped with the operation.
I was present on Friday night and Saturday night when
Dr. Carl Holliday was present. On Friday night she was
suffering intense pain and he gave her a hypodermic and
it still didn't relieve her. Of course, it relieved her
to a certain extent but didn't relieve the pain entirely.
And on Saturday night Dr. Holliday wes called again
while I was there and Dr. Holliday came out and she
suffered intensely and he gave her a hyposermic and that
did not relieve her and he then used an outer instrument,
I don't know what it is called, and removed clods after
clods and a eord about this long (indicating eight or
Saturday
ten inches),- that was on Exiday night following the
Friday night; the first night I was there was Friday
night and the next night was Saturday night. There
was a cord about this long that he removed, - very near
the size of my little finger, and clods after clods
that be removed on Saturday night. I stayed all night
Saturday night and Sunday morning they came out about
63


#21.
nine-thirty; it was the time they had set for this
operation. That looks very much like the same
instrument he used on Saturday night. It was just the
outer surface he used the instrument on Saturday night,
for he didn't use the instrument that went up into the
womb. I will call it that way,- he did not on Saturday
night. On Friday night when Dr. Holliday came out the
first thing he did he called for a class of water and
rinsed his thermometer and took her temperature and her
temperature was 103; her fe ver never ceased during the

QUESTIONS BY MR. RUCKER:
Just about this lenght was the length of
the cord, - I would imagine about nine or ten inches. The
odor was very offensive indeed during the operation
on Saturday night and Sunday morning too. Dr. Summerlin
made this remark, said "Doc, don't you think Miss Parr
standing on her feet in the office is against her", and
Carl Holliday turned and said "Yes, I wouldn't be
surprised", and Carl Holliday made this remakk "did you
get that odor" and I said "I certainly did." It was
so offensdve you couldn't hardly stay in the position
I was in during the operation.
Mrs. Fillingham was not cross examined.

W. E. JACKSON, sworn for the State, testified
as follows:
I am sheriff of Clarke County. About
the 20th day of February I did know Dr. Summerlin.
I have known him several years, - ever since he has been
here. I don't know how long he has been here. I do
not know whether he was in Athens on the 20th day of
February or not, or the 1st day of March. I don't
know what time he left, but he has been away some time.
W. E. JACKSON on Cross Examination:
The defendant, Dr. Summerlin, is in my custody
as sheriff and jailer of this county.
H. W. BEUSSEE, sworn for the State testified
as follows:
I am Chief of Police of Athens, Georgia. I
remember the occasion in March when Dr. Summerlin was
said to have fainted at the foot of the elevator in the
Southern Mutual Building; I don't temember the date. I
was at Costa's cafe and saw him after he was on the floor,
but after that time I do not know what became of him; I
do not know whether he stayed in town or left town; I
did not see him. I went out in the lobby and made the
crowd get back; I didnt know who it was.
I don't
remember seeing him from the 1st day of March on through
April; I don't remember seeing him after the day he was
laying on the floor sick.

MISS LEILA MAE HULL, sworn for the State, testified
as follows:
I went up to have my teeth cleaned and Dr.
Summerlin worked on my teeth for a few minutes and as he
was working on my teeth he mentioned that he had not
been well, was feeling badly that morning. Then he
vient out. He came back in and did a little bit more
work in my mouth and finished his work; he swabbed my
mouth out with iodine and taen went out. I was in the
chair at the time he went out, and his office girl
removed the bib. I waited for him to come back, I guess
probably, a matter of minutes, very few minutes. I don't
know whether or not he had any conversation over the
telephone during that time. I heard his voice in the
next room. When I went out of there Dr. Summerlin was
just inside the inner door of his office, - I then went
to the elevator and Dr. Summerlin got on with me, and
he said he felt badly, - that was all. He told some
man, the man said "hello DOC", how are you", and he
said "I am not very well" or some thing like that, and as
the elevator went down he said "I feel as if I might
faint." He fainted; he doubled up. I did nothing .
They spread him out. I asked them to lay him down on
the floor in the lobby and they laid him down and he was
unconscious and I ran in costa's and got some aromatic
spirits of amonia.
MISS LEILA MAE HULL Was not cross examined.
